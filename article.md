Introduction
------------

The goal of this article is to provide a fairly comprehensive
introduction to the Clojure programming language. A large number of
features are covered, each in a fairly brief manner. Feel free to skip
around to the sections of most interest. The section names in the table
of contents are hyperlinks to make this easier when reading on-line.

Please send feedback on errors and ways to improve explanations to
[mark@ociweb.com](mailto:mark@ociweb.com), or fork [the
repository](https://github.com/mvolkmann/Clojure-Article) and send a
pull-request. I'm especially interested in feedback such as:

-   You said X, but the correct thing to say is Y.
-   You said X, but it would be more clear if you said Y.
-   You didn't discuss X and I think it is an important topic.

Updates to this article that indicate the "last updated" date and
provide a dated list of changes will be provided at

Also see my article on software transactional memory and the Clojure
implementation of it at
[http://www.ociweb.com/mark/stm/](http://www.ociweb.com/mark/stm/).

Code examples in this article often show the return value of a function
call or its output in a line comment (begins with a semicolon) followed
by "-\>" and the result. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(+ 1 2) ; showing return value -> 3
(println "Hello") ; return value is nil, showing output -> Hello
~~~~

Functional Programming
----------------------

[Functional
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is a
style of programming that emphasizes "first-class" functions that are
"pure". It was inspired by ideas from the [lambda
calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).

"Pure functions" are functions that always return the same result when
passed the same arguments, as opposed to depending on state that can
change with time. This makes them much easier to understand, debug and
test. They have no side effects such as changing global state or
performing any kind of I/O, including file I/O and database updates.
State is maintained in the values of function parameters saved on the
stack (often placed there by recursive calls) rather than in global
variables saved on the heap. This allows functions to be executed
repeatedly without affecting global state (an important characteristic
to consider when transactions are discussed later). It also opens the
door for smart compilers to improve performance by automatically
reordering and parallelizing code, although the latter is not yet
common.

In practice, applications need to have some side effects. Simon
Peyton-Jones, a major contributor to the functional programming language
Haskell, said the following: "In the end, any program must manipulate
state. A program that has no side effects whatsoever is a kind of black
box. All you can tell is that the box gets hotter."
([http://oscon.blip.tv/file/324976](http://oscon.blip.tv/file/324976))
The key is to limit side effects, clearly identify them, and avoid
scattering them throughout the code.

Languages that support "first-class functions" allow functions to be
held in variables, passed to other functions and returned from them. The
ability to return a function supports selection of behavior to be
executed later. Functions that accept other functions as arguments are
called "higher-order functions". In a sense, their operation is
configured by the functions that are passed to them. The functions
passed in can be executed any number of times, including not at all.

Data in functional programming languages is typically immutable. This
allows data to be accessed concurrently from multiple threads without
locking. There's no need to lock data that can't be changed. With
multicore processors becoming prevalent, this simplification of
programming for concurrency is perhaps the biggest benefit of functional
programming.

If all of this sounds intriguing and you're ready to try functional
programming, be prepared for a sizable learning curve. Many claim that
functional programming isn't more difficult than object-oriented
programming, it's just different. Taking the time to learn this style of
programming is a worthwhile investment in order to obtain the benefits
described above.

Popular functional programming languages include
[Clojure](http://clojure.org/), [Common
Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp),
[Erlang](http://erlang.org/),
[F\#](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/default.aspx),
[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/),
[ML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)),
[OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/index.en.html),
[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) and
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). Clojure and Scala were written to
run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Other functional programming
languages that have implementations that run on the JVM include: [Armed
Bear Common Lisp (ABCL)](http://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/),
[OCaml-Java](http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/) and [Kawa
(Scheme)](http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/).

Clojure Overview
----------------

Clojure is a dynamically-typed, functional programming language that
runs on the JVM (Java 5 or greater) and provides interoperability with
Java. A major goal of the language is to make it easier to implement
applications that access data from multiple threads (concurrency).

Clojure is pronounced the same as the word "closure". The creator of the
language, Rich Hickey, explains the name this way: "I wanted to involve
C (C\#), L (Lisp) and J (Java). Once I came up with Clojure, given the
pun on closure, the available domains and vast emptiness of the
googlespace, it was an easy decision."

Soon Clojure will also be available for the .NET platform. ClojureCLR is
an implementation of Clojure that runs on the Microsoft Common Language
Runtime instead of the JVM. At the time of this writing it is considered
to be alpha quality.

In July 2011, ClojureScript was announced. It compiles Clojure code to
JavaScript. See
[https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript).

Clojure is an open source language released under the [Eclipse Public
License v 1.0](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) (EPL). This is
a very liberal license. See
[http://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php)
for more information.

Running on the JVM provides portability, stability, performance and
security. It also provides access to a wealth of existing Java libraries
supporting functionality including file I/O, multithreading, database
access, GUIs, web applications, and much more.

Each "operation" in Clojure is implemented as either a function, macro
or special form. Nearly all functions and macros are implemented in
Clojure source code. The differences between functions and macros are
explained later. Special forms are recognized by the Clojure compiler
and not implemented in Clojure source code. There are a relatively small
number of special forms and new ones cannot be implemented. They include
[catch](http://clojure.org/special_forms#try),
[def](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc1),
[do](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc3),
[dot](http://clojure.org/java_interop#dot) ('.'),
[finally](http://clojure.org/special_forms#try),
[fn](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc7),
[if](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc2),
[let](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc4),
[loop](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc9),
[monitor-enter](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc13),
[monitor-exit](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc14),
[new](http://clojure.org/java_interop#new),
[quote](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc5),
[recur](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc12),
[set!](http://clojure.org/java_interop#set),
[throw](http://clojure.org/special_forms#try),
[try](http://clojure.org/special_forms#try) and
[var](http://clojure.org/special_forms#toc6).

Clojure provides many functions that make it easy to operate on
"sequences" which are logical views of collections. Many things can be
treated as sequences. These include Java collections, Clojure-specific
collections, strings, streams, directory structures and XML trees. New
instances of Clojure collections can be created from existing ones in an
efficient manner because they are [persistent data
structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure).

Clojure provides three ways of safely sharing mutable data, all of which
use mutable references to immutable data. [Refs](#Refs) provide
synchronous access to multiple pieces of shared data ("coordinated") by
using [Software Transactional
Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory)
(STM). [Atoms](#Atoms) provide synchronous access to a single piece of
shared data. [Agents](#Agents) provide asynchronous access to a single
piece of shared data. These are discussed in more detail in the
"[Reference Types](#ReferenceTypes)" section.

Clojure is a
[Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))
dialect. However, it makes some departures from older Lisps. For
example, older Lisps use the `car` function to get the first item in a
list. Clojure calls this `first` as does Common Lisp. For a list of
other differences, see
[http://clojure.org/lisps](http://clojure.org/lisps).

Lisp has a syntax that many people loveâ€¦ and many people hate, mainly
due to its use of parentheses and prefix notation. If you tend toward
the latter camp, consider these facts. Many text editors and IDEs
highlight matching parentheses, so it isn't necessary to count them in
order to ensure they are balanced. Clojure function calls are less noisy
than Java method calls. A Java method call looks like this:

~~~~ {.clojure}
methodName(arg1, arg2, arg3);
~~~~

A Clojure function call looks like this:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(function-name arg1 arg2 arg3)
~~~~

The open paren moves to the front and the commas and semicolon
disappear. This syntax is referred to as a "form". There is simple
beauty in the fact that everything in Lisp has this form. Note that the
naming convention in Clojure is to use all lowercase with hyphens
separating words in multi-word names, unlike the Java convention of
using camelcase.

Defining functions is similarly less noisy in Clojure. The Clojure
`println` function adds a space between the output from each of its
arguments. To avoid this, pass the same arguments to the `str` function
and pass its result to `println` .

~~~~ {.java}
// Java
public void hello(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
}
~~~~

~~~~ {.clojure}
; Clojure
(defn hello [name]
  (println "Hello," name))
~~~~

Clojure makes heavy use of lazy evaluation. This allows functions to be
invoked only when their result is needed. "Lazy sequences" are
collections of results that are not computed until needed. This supports
the efficient creation of infinite collections.

Clojure code is processed in three phases: read-time, compile-time and
run-time. At read-time the Reader reads source code and converts it to a
data structure, mostly a list of lists of listsâ€¦ At compile-time this
data structure is converted to Java bytecode. At run-time the bytecode
is executed. Functions are only invoked at run-time. Macros are special
constructs whose invocation looks similar to that of functions, but are
expanded into new Clojure code at compile-time.

Is Clojure code hard to understand? Imagine if every time you read Java
source code and encountered syntax elements like `if` statements, `for`
loops, and anonymous classes, you had to pause and puzzle over what they
mean. There are certain things that must be obvious to a person who
wants to be a productive Java developer. Likewise there are parts of
Clojure syntax that must be obvious for one to efficiently read and
understand code. Examples include being comfortable with the use of
`let`, `apply`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce` and anonymous functionsâ€¦ all
of which are described later.

Getting Started
---------------

Clojure code for your own library and application projects will
typically reside in its own directory (named after the project) and will
be managed by the [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/index.html) project
management tool. Leiningen (or "lein" for short) will take care of
downloading Clojure for you and making it available to your projects. To
start using Clojure, you don't need to install Clojure, nor deal with
jar files or the `java` command â€” just install and use `lein`
(instructions on the Leiningen homepage, linked to above).

Once you've installed lein, create a trivial project to start playing
around with:

~~~~ {.bash}
cd ~/temp
lein new my-proj
cd my-proj
lein repl     # starts up the interactive REPL
~~~~

To create a new *application* project, do "`lein new app my-app`"

For more about getting started, see
[http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started).

Clojure Syntax
--------------

Lisp dialects have a very simple, some would say beautiful, syntax. Data
and code have the same representation, lists of lists that can be
represented in memory quite naturally as a tree. `(a b c)` is a call to
a function named `a` with arguments `b` and `c`. To make this data
instead of code, the list needs to be quoted. `'(a b c)` or
`(quote (a b c))` is a list of the values `a`, `b` and `c`. That's it
except for some special cases. The number of special cases there are
depends on the dialect.

The special cases are seen by some as syntactic sugar. The more of them
there are, the shorter certain kinds of code become and the more readers
of the code have to learn and remember. It's a tricky balance. Many of
them have an equivalent function name that can be used instead. I'll
leave it to you to decide if Clojure has too much or too little
syntactic sugar.

The table below briefly describes each of the special cases encountered
in Clojure code. These will be described in more detail later. Don't try
to understand everything in the table now.

  unquote splicing (used in macros)                                                                            `~@value`                                                            none

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lisp dialects use prefix notation rather than the typical infix notation
used by most programming languages for binary operators such as `+` and
`*`. For example, in Java one might write `a + b + c`, whereas in a Lisp
dialect this becomes `(+ a b c)`. One benefit of this notation is that
any number of arguments can be specified without repeating the operator.
Binary operators from other languages are Lisp functions that aren't
restricted to two operands.

One reason Lisp code contains more parentheses than code in other
languages is that it also uses them where languages like Java use curly
braces. For example, the statements in a Java method are inside curly
braces, whereas the expressions in a Lisp function are inside the
function definition which is surrounded by parentheses.

Compare the following snippets of Java and Clojure code that each define
a simple function and invoke it. The output from both is "edray" and
"orangeay".

~~~~ {.java}
// This is Java code.
public class PigLatin {

    public static String pigLatin(String word) {
        char firstLetter = word.charAt(0);
        if ("aeiou".indexOf(firstLetter) != -1) return word + "ay";
        return word.substring(1) + firstLetter + "ay";
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println(pigLatin("red"));
        System.out.println(pigLatin("orange"));
    }
}
~~~~

~~~~ {.clojure}
; This is Clojure code.
; When a set is used as a function, it returns a boolean
; that indicates whether the argument is in the set.
(def vowel? (set "aeiou"))

(defn pig-latin [word] ; defines a function
  ; word is expected to be a string
  ; which can be treated like a sequence of characters.
  (let [first-letter (first word)] ; assigns a local binding
    (if (vowel? first-letter)
      (str word "ay") ; then part of if
      (str (subs word 1) first-letter "ay")))) ; else part of if

(println (pig-latin "red"))
(println (pig-latin "orange"))
~~~~

Clojure supports all the common data types such as booleans (with
literal values of `true` and `false`), integers, decimals, characters
(see "character literal" in the table above) and strings. It also
supports ratios which retain a numerator and denominator so numeric
precision is not lost when they are used in calculations.

Symbols are used to name things. These names are scoped in a namespace,
either one that is specified or the default namespace. Symbols evaluate
to their value. To access the `Symbol` object itself, it must be quoted.

Keywords begin with a colon and are used as unique identifiers. Examples
include keys in maps and enumerated values (such as `:red`, `:green` and
`:blue`).

It is possible in Clojure, as it is any programming language, to write
code that is difficult to understand. Following a few guidelines can
make a big difference. Write short, well-focused functions to make them
easier to read, test and reuse. Use the "extract method" refactoring
pattern often. Deeply nested function calls can be hard to read. Limit
this nesting where possible, often by using `let` to break complicated
expressions into several less complicated expressions. Passing anonymous
functions to named functions is common. However, avoid passing anonymous
functions to other anonymous functions because such code is difficult to
read.

REPL
----

REPL stands for read-eval-print loop. This is a standard tool in Lisp
dialects that allows a user to enter expressions, have them read and
evaluated, and have their result printed. It is a very useful tool for
testing and gaining an understanding of code.

To start a REPL, run the script created earlier by entering "`clj`" at a
command prompt. This will display a prompt of "`user=>`". The part
before "`=>`" indicates the current default namespace. Forms entered
after this prompt are evaluated and their result is output. Here's a
sample REPL session that shows both input and output.

~~~~ {.clojure}
user=> (def n 2)
#'user/n
user=> (* n 3)
6
~~~~

`def` is a special form that doesn't evaluate its first argument, but
instead uses the literal value as a name. Its REPL output shows that a
symbol named "`n`" in the namespace "`user`" was defined.

To view documentation for a function, macro or namespace, enter
`(doc name)`. If it is a macro, the word "Macro" will appear on a line
by itself immediately after its parameter list. The item for which
documentation is being requested must already be loaded (see the
[require](#require) function). For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(require 'clojure.string)
(doc clojure.string/join) ; ->
; -------------------------
; clojure.string/join
; ([coll] [separator coll])
;   Returns a string of all elements in coll, as returned by (seq coll),
;    separated by an optional separator.
~~~~

To find documentation on all functions/macros whose name or
documentation string contains a given string, enter `(find-doc "text")`.

To see the source for a function/macro, enter `(source name)`. `source`
is a macro defined in the `clojure.repl` namespace which is
automatically loaded in the REPL environment.

To load and execute the forms in a source file, enter
`(load-file "file-path")`. Typically these files have a `.clj`
extension.

To exit the REPL under Windows, type ctrl-z followed by the enter key or
just ctrl-c. To exit the REPL on every other platform (including UNIX,
Linux and Mac OS X), type ctrl-d.

Vars
----

Clojure provides bindings to Vars, which are containers bound to mutable
storage locations. There are global bindings, thread-local bindings,
bindings that are local to a function, and bindings that are local to a
given form.

Function parameters are bound to Vars that are local to the function.

The `def` special form binds a value to a symbol. It provides a
mechanism to define metadata, `:dynamic`, which allows a thread-local
value within the scope of a `binding` call. In other words, it allows
re-definition of assigned value per execution thread and scope. If the
Var is not re-assigned to a new value in a separate execution thread,
the Var refers to the value of the root binding, if accessed from
another thread.

The `let` special form creates bindings to Vars that are bound to the
scope within the statement. Its first argument is a vector containing
name/expression pairs. The expressions are evaluated in order and their
results are assigned to the names on their left. These Vars can be used
in the binding of other Vars declared within the vector. The expressions
following the Var declaration vector contain the Var(s) that are
executed only within the `let` scope. Vars within functions that are
called within `let` but defined outside of that scope are not affected
by the declarations in the `let`'s vector.

The `binding` macro is similar to `let`, but it gives new, thread-local
values to existing global bindings throughout the scope's thread of
execution. The values of Vars bound within the `let` vector argument are
also used in functions, if they use the same Var names, called from
inside that scope. When the execution thread leaves the `binding`
macro's scope, the global Var bindings revert to their previous values.
Starting in Clojure 1.3, binding can only do this for vars declared
`:dynamic`.

Vars intended to be bound to new, thread-local values using `binding`
have their own naming convention. These symbols have names that begin
and end with an asterisk. Examples that appear in this article include
`*command-line-args*`, `*agent*`, `*err*`, `*flush-on-newline*`, `*in*`,
`*load-tests*`, `*ns*`, `*out*`, `*print-length*`, `*print-level*` and
`*stack-trace-depth*`. Functions that use these bindings are affected by
their values. For example, binding a new value to `*out*` changes the
output destination of the `println` function.

The following code demonstrates usage of `def`, `defn`, `let`,
`binding`, and `println`.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def ^:dynamic v 1) ; v is a global binding

(defn f1 []
  (println "f1: v:" v)) 

(defn f2 []
  (println "f2: before let v:" v) 
  ; creates local binding v that shadows global one
  (let [v 2]
    ; local binding only within this let statement
    (println "f2: in let, v:" v)
    (f1))
  ; outside of this let, v refers to global binding
  (println "f2: after let v:" v))

(defn f3 []
  (println "f3: before binding v:" v) 
  ; same global binding with new, temporary value
  (binding [v 3] 
    ; global binding, new value
    (println "f3: within binding function v: " v) 
    (f1)) ; calling f1 with new value to v
  ; outside of binding v refers to first global value
  (println "f3: after binding v:" v)) 

(defn f4 []
 (def v 4)) ; changes the value of v in the global scope

(println "(= v 1) => " (= v 1))
(println "Calling f2: ")
(f2)
(println)
(println "Calling f3: ")
(f3)
(println)
(println "Calling f4: ")
(f4)
(println "after calling f4, v =" v)
~~~~

To run the code above, save it in a file named "vars.clj" and use the
shell script for executing Clojure files described earlier as follows:

~~~~ {.bash}
$ clj vars.clj
~~~~

The output produced by the code above follows:

~~~~
; (= v 1) =>  true
Calling f2 
f2: before let v: 1
f2: in let, v: 2
f1: v: 1
f2: after let v: 1

Calling f3 
f3: before binding v: 1
f3: within binding function v:  3
f1: v: 3
f3: after binding v: 1

Calling f4 
after calling f4, v: 4
~~~~

#### Recap:

Notice in the first call to f2, the `let` function's binding to v did
not change its originally declared value, as is shown in the call to f1
within the `let` statement. The value of v in f1 is 1, not 2.

Next, inside f3 within the scope of the `binding` call, the value of v
was re-assigned within f1 since f1 was called within the execution
thread of `binding` call's scope. Once f3's function execution thread
exits from the `binding` call, v is bound to the initially declared
binding, 1.

When f4 is called, the binding of v is not within the context of a new
execution thread so v is bound to the new value, 4, in the global scope.
Remember that changing a global value is not necessarily a best
practice. It is presented in f4's definition for demonstration purposes.

Collections
-----------

Clojure provides the collection types list, vector, set and map. Clojure
can also use any of the Java collection classes, but this is not
typically done because the Clojure variety are a much better fit for
functional programming.

The Clojure collection types have characteristics that differ from
Java's collection types. All of them are immutable, heterogeneous and
persistent. Being immutable means that their contents cannot be changed.
Being heterogeneous means that they can hold any kind of object. Being
persistent means that old versions of them are preserved when new
versions are created. Clojure does this in a very efficient manner where
new versions share memory with old versions. For example, a new version
of a map containing thousands of key/value pairs where just one value
needs to be modified can be created quickly and consumes very little
additional memory.

There are many core functions that operate on all kinds of collectionsâ€¦
far too many to describe here. A small subset of them are described next
using vectors. Keep in mind that since Clojure collections are
immutable, there are no functions that modify them. Instead, there are
many functions that use the magic of [persistent data
structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) to
efficiently create new collections from existing ones. Also, some
functions that operate on a collection (for example, a vector) return a
collection of a different type (for example, a `LazySeq`) that has
different characteristics.

WARNING: This section presents information about Clojure collections
that is important to learn. However, it drones on a bit, presenting
function after function for operating on various types of collections.
Should drowsiness set in, please skip ahead to the sections that follow
and return to this section later.

The `count` function returns the number of items in any collection. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(count [19 "yellow" true]) ; -> 3
~~~~

The `conj` function, short for conjoin, adds one or more items to a
collection. Where they are added depends on the type of the collection.
This is explained in the information on specific collection types below.

The `reverse` function returns a sequence of the items in the collection
in reverse order.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(reverse [2 4 7]) ; -> (7 4 2)
~~~~

The `map` function applies a given function that takes one parameter to
each item in a collection, returning a lazy sequence of the results. It
can also apply functions that take more than one parameter if a
collection is supplied for each argument. If those collections contain
different numbers of items, the items used from each will be those at
the beginning up to the number of items in the smallest collection. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
; The next line uses an anonymous function that adds 3 to its argument.
(map #(+ % 3) [2 4 7]) ; -> (5 7 10)
(map + [2 4 7] [5 6] [1 2 3 4]) ; adds corresponding items -> (8 12)
~~~~

The `apply` function returns the result of a given function when all the
items in a given collection are used as arguments. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(apply + [2 4 7]); -> 13
~~~~

There are many functions that retrieve a single item from a collection.
For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def stooges ["Moe" "Larry" "Curly" "Shemp"])
(first stooges) ; -> "Moe"
(second stooges) ; -> "Larry"
(last stooges) ; -> "Shemp"
(nth stooges 2) ; indexes start at 0 -> "Curly"
~~~~

There are many functions that retrieve several items from a collection.
For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(next stooges) ; -> ("Larry" "Curly" "Shemp")
(butlast stooges) ; -> ("Moe" "Larry" "Curly")
(drop-last 2 stooges) ; -> ("Moe" "Larry")
; Get names containing more than three characters.
(filter #(> (count %) 3) stooges) ; -> ("Larry" "Curly" "Shemp")
(nthnext stooges 2) ; -> ("Curly" "Shemp")
~~~~

There are several predicate functions that test the items in a
collection and have a boolean result. These "short-circuit" so they only
evaluate as many items as necessary to determine their result. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(every? #(instance? String %) stooges) ; -> true
(not-every? #(instance? String %) stooges) ; -> false
(some #(instance? Number %) stooges) ; -> nil
(not-any? #(instance? Number %) stooges) ; -> true
~~~~

### Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items. They are ideal when new items
will be added to or removed from the front (constant-time). They are not
efficient (linear time) for finding items by index (using `nth`) and
there is no efficient way to change items by index.

Here are some ways to create a list that all have the same result:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def stooges (list "Moe" "Larry" "Curly"))
(def stooges (quote ("Moe" "Larry" "Curly")))
(def stooges '("Moe" "Larry" "Curly"))
~~~~

The `some` function can be used to determine if a collection contains a
given item. It takes a predicate function and a collection. While it may
seem tedious to need to specify a predicate function in order to test
for the existence of a single item, it is somewhat intentional to
discourage this usage. Searching a list for a single item is a linear
operation. Using a set instead of a list is more efficient and easier.
Nevertheless, it can be done as follows:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(some #(= % "Moe") stooges) ; -> true 
(some #(= % "Mark") stooges) ; -> nil 
; Another approach is to create a set from the list
; and then use the contains? function on the set as follows.
(contains? (set stooges) "Moe") ; -> true
~~~~

Both the `conj` and `cons` functions create a new list that contains
additional items added to the front. The `remove` function creates a new
list containing only the items for which a predicate function returns
false. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def more-stooges (conj stooges "Shemp")) ; -> ("Shemp" "Moe" "Larry" "Curly")
(def less-stooges (remove #(= % "Curly") more-stooges)) ; -> ("Shemp" "Moe" "Larry")
~~~~

The `into` function creates a new list that contains all the items in
two lists. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def kids-of-mike '("Greg" "Peter" "Bobby"))
(def kids-of-carol '("Marcia" "Jan" "Cindy"))
(def brady-bunch (into kids-of-mike kids-of-carol))
(println brady-bunch) ; -> (Cindy Jan Marcia Greg Peter Bobby)
~~~~

The `peek` and `pop` functions can be used to treat a list as a stack.
They operate on the beginning or head of the list.

### Vectors

Vectors are also ordered collections of items. They are ideal when new
items will be added to or removed from the back (constant-time). This
means that using `conj` is more efficient than `cons` for adding items.
They are efficient (constant time) for finding (using `nth`) or changing
(using `assoc`) items by index. Function definitions specify their
parameter list using a vector.

Here are some ways to create a vector:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def stooges (vector "Moe" "Larry" "Curly"))
(def stooges ["Moe" "Larry" "Curly"])
~~~~

Unless the list characteristic of being more efficient at adding to or
removing from the front is significant for a given use, vectors are
typically preferred over lists. This is mainly due to the vector syntax
of `[...]` being a bit more appealing than the list syntax of `'(...)`.
It doesn't have the possibility of being confused with a call to a
function, macro or special form.

The `get` function retrieves an item from a vector by index. As shown
later, it also retrieves a value from a map by key. Indexes start from
zero. The `get` function is similar to the `nth` function. Both take an
optional value to be returned if the index is out of range. If this is
not supplied and the index is out of range, `get` returns `nil` and
`nth` throws an exception. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(get stooges 1 "unknown") ; -> "Larry"
(get stooges 3 "unknown") ; -> "unknown"
~~~~

The `assoc` function operates on vectors and maps. When applied to a
vector, it creates a new vector where the item specified by an index is
replaced. If the index is equal to the number of items in the vector, a
new item is added to the end. If it is greater than the number of items
in the vector, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(assoc stooges 2 "Shemp") ; -> ["Moe" "Larry" "Shemp"]
~~~~

The `subvec` function returns a new vector that is a subset of an
existing one that retains the order of the items. It takes a vector, a
start index and an optional end index. If the end index is omitted, the
subset runs to the end. The new vector shares the structure of the
original one.

All the code examples provided above for lists also work for vectors.
The `peek` and `pop` functions also work with vectors, but operate on
the end or tail rather than the beginning or head as they do for lists.
The `conj` function creates a new vector that contains an additional
item added to the back. The `cons` function creates a new vector that
contains an additional item added to the front.

### Sets

Sets are collections of unique items. They are preferred over lists and
vectors when duplicates are not allowed and items do not need to be
maintained in the order in which they were added. Clojure supports two
kinds of sets, unsorted and sorted. If the items being added to a sorted
set can't be compared to each other, a `ClassCastException` is thrown.
Here are some ways to create a set:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def stooges (hash-set "Moe" "Larry" "Curly")) ; not sorted
(def stooges #{"Moe" "Larry" "Curly"}) ; same as previous
(def stooges (sorted-set "Moe" "Larry" "Curly"))
~~~~

The `contains?` function operates on sets and maps. When used on a set,
it determines whether the set contains a given item. This is much
simpler than using the `some` function which is needed to test this with
a list or vector. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(contains? stooges "Moe") ; -> true 
(contains? stooges "Mark") ; -> false 
~~~~

Sets can be used as functions of their items. When used in this way,
they return the item or nil. This provides an even more compact way to
test whether a set contains a given item. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(stooges "Moe") ; -> "Moe"
(stooges "Mark") ; -> nil 
(println (if (stooges person) "stooge" "regular person"))
~~~~

The `conj` and `into` functions demonstrated above with lists also work
with sets. The location where the items are added is only defined for
sorted sets.

The `disj` function creates a new set where one or more items are
removed. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def more-stooges (conj stooges "Shemp")) ; -> #{"Moe" "Larry" "Curly" "Shemp"}
(def less-stooges (disj more-stooges "Curly")) ; -> #{"Moe" "Larry" "Shemp"}
~~~~

Also consider the functions in the `clojure.set` namespace which
include: `difference`, `index`, `intersection`, `join`, `map-invert`,
`project`, `rename`, `rename-keys`, `select` and `union`. Some of these
functions operate on maps instead of sets.

### Maps

Maps store associations between keys and their corresponding values
where both can be any kind of object. Often keywords are used for map
keys. Entries can be stored in such a way that the pairs can be quickly
retrieved in sorted order based on their keys.

Here are some ways to create maps that store associations from popsicle
colors to their flavors where the keys and values are both keywords. The
commas aid readability. They are optional and are treated as whitespace.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def popsicle-map
  (hash-map :red :cherry, :green :apple, :purple :grape))
(def popsicle-map
  {:red :cherry, :green :apple, :purple :grape}) ; same as previous
(def popsicle-map
  (sorted-map :red :cherry, :green :apple, :purple :grape))
~~~~

Maps can be used as functions of their keys. Also, in some cases keys
can be used as functions of maps. For example, keyword keys can, but
string and integer keys cannot. The following are all valid ways to get
the flavor of green popsicles, which is `:apple`:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(get popsicle-map :green)
(popsicle-map :green)
(:green popsicle-map)
~~~~

The `contains?` function operates on sets and maps. When used on a map,
it determines whether the map contains a given key. The `keys` function
returns a sequence containing all the keys in a given map. The `vals`
function returns a sequence containing all the values in a given map.
For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(contains? popsicle-map :green) ; -> true
(keys popsicle-map) ; -> (:red :green :purple)
(vals popsicle-map) ; -> (:cherry :apple :grape)
~~~~

The `assoc` function operates on maps and vectors. When applied to a
map, it creates a new map where any number of key/value pairs are added.
Values for existing keys are replaced by new values. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(assoc popsicle-map :green :lime :blue :blueberry)
; -> {:blue :blueberry, :green :lime, :purple :grape, :red :cherry}
~~~~

The `dissoc` function takes a map and any number of keys. It returns a
new map where those keys are removed. Specified keys that aren't in the
map are ignored. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(dissoc popsicle-map :green :blue) ; -> {:purple :grape, :red :cherry}
~~~~

When used in the context of a sequence, maps are treated like a sequence
of `clojure.lang.MapEntry` objects. This can be combined with the use of
[doseq](#ListComprehension) and [destructuring](#Destructuring), both of
which are described in more detail later, to easily iterate through all
the keys and values. The following example iterates through all the
key/value pairs in `popsicle-map` and binds the key to `color` and the
value to `flavor`. The `name` function returns the string name of a
keyword.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(doseq [[color flavor] popsicle-map]
  (println (str "The flavor of " (name color)
    " popsicles is " (name flavor) ".")))
~~~~

The output produced by the code above follows:

~~~~
The flavor of green popsicles is apple.
The flavor of purple popsicles is grape.
The flavor of red popsicles is cherry.
~~~~

The `select-keys` function takes a map and a sequence of keys. It
returns a new map where only those keys are in the map. Specified keys
that aren't in the map are ignored. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(select-keys popsicle-map [:red :green :blue]) ; -> {:green :apple, :red :cherry}
~~~~

The `conj` function adds all the key/value pairs from one map to
another. If any keys in the source map already exist in the target map,
the target map values are replaced by the corresponding source map
values.

Values in maps can be maps, and they can be nested to any depth.
Retrieving nested values is easy. Likewise, creating new maps where
nested values are modified is easy.

To demonstrate this we'll create a map that describes a person. It has a
key whose value describes their address using a map. It also has a key
whose value describes their employer which has its own address map.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def person {
  :name "Mark Volkmann"
  :address {
    :street "644 Glen Summit"
    :city "St. Charles"
    :state "Missouri"
    :zip 63304}
  :employer {
    :name "Object Computing, Inc."
    :address {
      :street "12140 Woodcrest Executive Drive, Suite 250"
      :city "Creve Coeur"
      :state "Missouri"
      :zip 63141}}})
~~~~

The `get-in` function takes a map and a key sequence. It returns the
value of the nested map key at the end of the sequence. The `->` macro
and the `reduce` function can also be used for this purpose. All of
these are demonstrated below to retrieve the employer city which is
"Creve Coeur".

~~~~ {.clojure}
(get-in person [:employer :address :city])
(-> person :employer :address :city) ; explained below
(reduce get person [:employer :address :city]) ; explained below
~~~~

The `->` macro, referred to as the "thread" macro, calls a series of
functions, passing the result of each as an argument to the next. For
example the following lines have the same result:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(f1 (f2 (f3 x)))
(-> x f3 f2 f1)
~~~~

There is also a `-?>` macro in the `clojure.core.incubator` namespace
that stops and returns nil if any function in the chain returns nil.
This avoids getting a `NullPointerException`.

The `reduce` function takes a function of two arguments, an optional
value and a collection. It begins by calling the function with either
the value and the first item in the collection or the first two items in
the collection if the value is omitted. It then calls the function
repeatedly with the previous function result and the next item in the
collection until every item in the collection has been processed. This
function is the same as `inject` in Ruby and `foldl` in Haskell.

The `assoc-in` function takes a map, a key sequence and a new value. It
returns a new map where the nested map key at the end of the sequence
has the new value. For example, a new map where the employer city is
changed to "Clayton" can be created as follows:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(assoc-in person [:employer :address :city] "Clayton")
~~~~

The `update-in` function takes a map, a key sequence, a function and any
number of additional arguments. The function is passed the old value of
the key at the end of the sequence and the additional arguments. The
value it returns is used as the new value of that key. For example, a
new map where the employer zip code is changed to a string in the U.S.
"ZIP + 4" format can be created using as follows:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(update-in person [:employer :address :zip] str "-1234") ; using the str function
~~~~

StructMaps
----------

Note: StructMaps have been deprecated. Records are generally recommended
instead. A section on Records will be added shortly.

StructMaps are similar to regular maps, but are optimized to take
advantage of common keys in multiple instances so they don't have to be
repeated. Their use is similar to that of Java Beans. Proper `equals`
and `hashCode` methods are generated for them. Accessor functions that
are faster than ordinary map key lookups can easily be created.

The `create-struct` function and `defstruct` macro, which uses
`create-struct`, both define StructMaps. The keys are normally specified
with keywords. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def vehicle-struct (create-struct :make :model :year :color)) ; long way
(defstruct vehicle-struct :make :model :year :color) ; short way
~~~~

The `struct` function creates an instance of a given StructMap. Values
must be specified in the same order as their corresponding keys were
specified when the StructMap was defined. Values for keys at the end can
be omitted and their values will be `nil`. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def vehicle (struct vehicle-struct "Toyota" "Prius" 2009))
~~~~

The `accessor` function creates a function for accessing the value of a
given key in instances that avoids performing a hash map lookup. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
; Note the use of def instead of defn because accessor returns
; a function that is then bound to "make".
(def make (accessor vehicle-struct :make))
(make vehicle) ; -> "Toyota"
(vehicle :make) ; same but slower
(:make vehicle) ; same but slower
~~~~

New keys not specified when the StructMap was defined can be added to
instances. However, keys specified when the StructMap was defined cannot
be removed from instances.

Defining Functions
------------------

The `defn` macro defines a function. Its arguments are the function
name, an optional documentation string (displayed by the `doc` macro),
the parameter list (specified with a vector that can be empty) and the
function body. The result of the last expression in the body is
returned. Every function returns a value, but it may be `nil`. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn parting
  "returns a String parting"
  [name]
  (str "Goodbye, " name)) ; concatenation

(println (parting "Mark")) ; -> Goodbye, Mark
~~~~

Function definitions must appear before their first use. Sometimes this
isn't possible due to a set of functions that invoke each other. The
`declare` special form takes any number of function names and creates
forward declarations that resolve these cases. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(declare function-names)
~~~~

Functions defined with the `defn-` macro are private. This means they
are only visible in the namespace in which they are defined. Other
macros that produce private definitions, such as `defmacro-`, are in
`clojure.core.incubator`.

Functions can take a variable number of parameters. Optional parameters
must appear at the end. They are gathered into a list by adding an
ampersand and a name for the list at the end of the parameter list.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn power [base & exponents]
  ; Using java.lang.Math static method pow.
  (reduce #(Math/pow %1 %2) base exponents))
(power 2 3 4) ; 2 to the 3rd = 8; 8 to the 4th = 4096
~~~~

Function definitions can contain more than one parameter list and
corresponding body. Each parameter list must contain a different number
of parameters. This supports overloading functions based on arity. Often
it is useful for a body to call the same function with a different
number of arguments in order to provide default values for some of them.
For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn parting
  "returns a String parting in a given language"
  ([] (parting "World"))
  ([name] (parting name "en"))
  ([name language]
    ; condp is similar to a case statement in other languages.
    ; It is described in more detail later.
    ; It is used here to take different actions based on whether the
    ; parameter "language" is set to "en", "es" or something else.
    (condp = language
      "en" (str "Goodbye, " name)
      "es" (str "Adios, " name)
      (throw (IllegalArgumentException.
        (str "unsupported language " language))))))

(println (parting)) ; -> Goodbye, World
(println (parting "Mark")) ; -> Goodbye, Mark
(println (parting "Mark" "es")) ; -> Adios, Mark
(println (parting "Mark", "xy"))
; -> java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: unsupported language xy
~~~~

Anonymous functions have no name. These are often passed as arguments to
a named function. They are handy for short function definitions that are
only used in one place. There are two ways to define them, shown below:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def years [1940 1944 1961 1985 1987])
(filter (fn [year] (even? year)) years) ; long way w/ named arguments -> (1940 1944)
(filter #(even? %) years) ; short way where % refers to the argument
~~~~

When an anonymous function is defined using the `fn` special form, the
body can contain any number of expressions.

When an anonymous function is defined in the short way using `#(...)`,
it can only contain a single expression. To use more than one
expression, wrap them in the `do` special form. If there is only one
parameter, it can be referred to with `%`. If there are multiple
parameters, they are referred to with `%1`, `%2` and so on. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn pair-test [test-fn n1 n2]
  (if (test-fn n1 n2) "pass" "fail"))

; Use a test-fn that determines whether
; the sum of its two arguments is an even number.
(println (pair-test #(even? (+ %1 %2)) 3 5)) ; -> pass
~~~~

Java methods can be overloaded based on parameter types. Clojure
functions can only be overloaded on arity. Clojure multimethods however,
can be overloaded based on anything.

The `defmulti` and `defmethod` macros are used together to define a
multimethod. The arguments to `defmulti` are the method name and the
dispatch function which returns a value that will be used to select a
method. The arguments to `defmethod` are the method name, the dispatch
value that triggers use of the method, the parameter list and the body.
The special dispatch value `:default` is used to designate a method to
be used when none of the others match. Each `defmethod` for the same
multimethod name must take the same number of arguments. The arguments
passed to a multimethod are passed to the dispatch function.

Here's an example of a multimethod that overloads based on type.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defmulti what-am-i class) ; class is the dispatch function
(defmethod what-am-i Number [arg] (println arg "is a Number"))
(defmethod what-am-i String [arg] (println arg "is a String"))
(defmethod what-am-i :default [arg] (println arg "is something else"))
(what-am-i 19) ; -> 19 is a Number
(what-am-i "Hello") ; -> Hello is a String
(what-am-i true) ; -> true is something else
~~~~

Since the dispatch function can be any function, including one you
write, the possibilities are endless. For example, a custom dispatch
function could examine its arguments and return a keyword to indicate a
size such as `:small`, `:medium` or `:large`. One method for each size
keyword can provide logic that is specific to a given size.

Underscores can be used as placeholders for function parameters that
won't be used and therefore don't need a name. This is often useful in
callback functions which are passed to another function so they can be
invoked later. A particular callback function may not use all the
arguments that are passed to it. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn callback1 [n1 n2 n3] (+ n1 n2 n3)) ; uses all three arguments
(defn callback2 [n1 _ n3] (+ n1 n3)) ; only uses 1st & 3rd arguments
(defn caller [callback value]
  (callback (+ value 1) (+ value 2) (+ value 3)))
(caller callback1 10) ; 11 + 12 + 13 -> 36
(caller callback2 10) ; 11 + 13 -> 24
~~~~

The `complement` function returns a new function that is just like a
given function, but returns the opposite logical truth value. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn teenager? [age] (and (>= age 13) (< age 20)))
(def non-teen? (complement teenager?))
(println (non-teen? 47)) ; -> true
~~~~

The `comp` function composes a new function by combining any number of
existing ones. They are called from right to left. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn times2 [n] (* n 2))
(defn minus3 [n] (- n 3))
; Note the use of def instead of defn because comp returns
; a function that is then bound to "my-composition".
(def my-composition (comp minus3 times2))
(my-composition 4) ; 4*2 - 3 -> 5
~~~~

The `partial` function creates a new function from an existing one so
that it provides fixed values for initial parameters and calls the
original function. This is called a "partial application". For example,
`*` is a function that takes any number of arguments and multiplies them
together. Suppose we want a new version of that function that always
multiplies by two.

~~~~ {.clojure}
; Note the use of def instead of defn because partial returns
; a function that is then bound to "times2".
(def times2 (partial * 2))
(times2 3 4) ; 2 * 3 * 4 -> 24
~~~~

Here's an interesting use of both the `map` and `partial` functions.
We'll define functions that use the `map` function to compute the value
of an arbitrary polynomial and its derivative for given x values. The
polynomials are described by a vector of their coefficients. Next, we'll
define functions that use `partial` to define functions for a specific
polynomial and its derivative. Finally, we'll demonstrate using the
functions.

The `range` function returns a lazy sequence of integers from an
inclusive lower bound to an exclusive upper bound. The lower bound
defaults to 0, the step size defaults to 1, and the upper bound defaults
to infinity.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn- polynomial
  "computes the value of a polynomial
   with the given coefficients for a given value x"
  [coefs x]
  ; For example, if coefs contains 3 values then exponents is (2 1 0).
  (let [exponents (reverse (range (count coefs)))]
    ; Multiply each coefficient by x raised to the corresponding exponent
    ; and sum those results.
    ; coefs go into %1 and exponents go into %2.
    (apply + (map #(* %1 (Math/pow x %2)) coefs exponents))))

(defn- derivative
  "computes the value of the derivative of a polynomial
   with the given coefficients for a given value x"
  [coefs x]
  ; The coefficients of the derivative function are obtained by
  ; multiplying all but the last coefficient by its corresponding exponent.
  ; The extra exponent will be ignored.
  (let [exponents (reverse (range (count coefs)))
        derivative-coefs (map #(* %1 %2) (butlast coefs) exponents)]
    (polynomial derivative-coefs x)))

(def f (partial polynomial [2 1 3])) ; 2x^2 + x + 3
(def f-prime (partial derivative [2 1 3])) ; 4x + 1

(println "f(2) =" (f 2)) ; -> 13.0
(println "f'(2) =" (f-prime 2)) ; -> 9.0
~~~~

Here's an another way that the polynomial function could be implemented
(suggested by Francesco Strino). For a polynomial with coefficients a, b
and c, it computes the value for x as follows:\
 %1 = a, %2 = b, result is ax + b\
 %1 = ax + b, %2 = c, result is (ax + b)x + c = ax\^2 + bx + c

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn- polynomial
  "computes the value of a polynomial
   with the given coefficients for a given value x"
  [coefs x]
  (reduce #(+ (* x %1) %2) coefs))
~~~~

The `memoize` function takes another function and returns a new function
that stores a mapping from previous arguments to previous results for
the given function. The new function uses the mapping to avoid invoking
the given function with arguments that have already been evaluated. This
results in better performance, but also requires memory to store the
mappings.

The `time` macro evaluates an expression, prints the elapsed time, and
returns the expression result. It is used in the following code to
measure the time to compute the value of a polynomial at a given x
value.

The following example demonstrates memoizing a polynomial function:

~~~~ {.clojure}
; Note the use of def instead of defn because memoize returns
; a function that is then bound to "memo-f".
(def memo-f (memoize f))

(println "priming call")
(time (f 2))

(println "without memoization")
; Note the use of an underscore for the binding that isn't used.
(dotimes [_ 3] (time (f 2)))

(println "with memoization")
(dotimes [_ 3] (time (memo-f 2)))
~~~~

The output produced by this code from a sample run is shown below.

~~~~
priming call
"Elapsed time: 4.128 msecs"
without memoization
"Elapsed time: 0.172 msecs"
"Elapsed time: 0.365 msecs"
"Elapsed time: 0.19 msecs"
with memoization
"Elapsed time: 0.241 msecs"
"Elapsed time: 0.033 msecs"
"Elapsed time: 0.019 msecs"
~~~~

There are several observations than can be made from this output. The
first call to the function `f`, the "priming call", takes considerably
longer than the other calls. This is true regardless of whether
memoization is used. The first call to the memoized function takes
longer than the first non-priming call to the original function, due to
the overhead of caching its result. Subsequent calls to the memoized
function are much faster.

Java Interoperability
---------------------

Clojure programs can use all Java classes and interfaces. As in Java,
classes in the `java.lang` package can be used without importing them.
Java classes in other packages can be used by either specifying their
package when referencing them or using the `import` function. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(import
  '(java.util Calendar GregorianCalendar)
  '(javax.swing JFrame JLabel))
~~~~

Also see the ` :import` directive of the `ns` macro which is described
later.

There are two ways to access constants in a Java class, shown in the
examples below:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(. java.util.Calendar APRIL) ; -> 3
(. Calendar APRIL) ; works if the Calendar class was imported
java.util.Calendar/APRIL
Calendar/APRIL ; works if the Calendar class was imported
~~~~

Invoking Java methods from Clojure code is very easy. Because of this,
Clojure doesn't provide functions for many common operations and instead
relies on Java methods. For example, Clojure doesn't provide a function
to find the absolute value of a floating point number because the `abs`
method of the Java class `java.lang.Math` class already does that. On
the other hand, while that class provides the method `max` to find the
largest of two values, it only works with two values, so Clojure
provides the `max` function which takes one or more values.

There are two ways to invoke a static method in a Java class, shown in
the examples below:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(. Math pow 2 4) ; -> 16.0
(Math/pow 2 4)
~~~~

There are two ways to invoke a constructor to create a Java object,
shown in the examples below. Note the use of the `def` special form to
retain a reference to the new object in a global binding. This is not
required. A reference could be retained in several other ways such as
adding it to a collection or passing it to a function.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(import '(java.util Calendar GregorianCalendar))
(def calendar (new GregorianCalendar 2008 Calendar/APRIL 16)) ; April 16, 2008
(def calendar (GregorianCalendar. 2008 Calendar/APRIL 16))
~~~~

There are two ways to invoke an instance method on a Java object, shown
in the examples below:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(. calendar add Calendar/MONTH 2)
(. calendar get Calendar/MONTH) ; -> 5
(.add calendar Calendar/MONTH 2)
(.get calendar Calendar/MONTH) ; -> 7
~~~~

The option in the examples above where the method name appears first is
generally preferred. The option where the object appears first is easier
to use inside macro definitions because syntax quoting can be used
instead of string concatenation. This statement will make more sense
after reading the "[Macros](#Macros)" section ahead.

Method calls can be chained using the `..` macro. The result from the
previous method call in the chain becomes the target of the next method
call. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(. (. calendar getTimeZone) getDisplayName) ; long way
(.. calendar getTimeZone getDisplayName) ; -> "Central Standard Time"
~~~~

There is also a `.?.` macro in the `clojure.core.incubator` namespace
that stops and returns nil if any method in the chain returns null. This
avoids getting a `NullPointerException`.

The `doto` macro is used to invoke many methods on the same object. It
returns the value of its first argument which is the target object. This
makes it convenient to create the target object with an expression that
is the first argument (see the creation of a `JFrame` GUI object in the
"[Namespaces](#doto)" section ahead). For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(doto calendar
  (.set Calendar/YEAR 1981)
  (.set Calendar/MONTH Calendar/AUGUST)
  (.set Calendar/DATE 1))
(def formatter (java.text.DateFormat/getDateInstance))
(.format formatter (.getTime calendar)) ; -> "Aug 1, 1981"
~~~~

The `memfn` macro expands to code that allows a Java method to be
treated as a first class function. It is an alternative to using an
anonymous function for calling a Java method. When using `memfn` to
invoke Java methods that take arguments, a name for each argument must
be specified. This indicates the arity of the method to be invoked.
These names are arbitrary, but they must be unique because they are used
in the generated code. The following examples apply an instance method
(`substring`) to a Java object from the first collection (a `String`),
passing the corresponding item from the second collection (an `int`) as
an argument:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(println (map #(.substring %1 %2)
           ["Moe" "Larry" "Curly"] [1 2 3])) ; -> (oe rry ly)

(println (map (memfn substring beginIndex)
           ["Moe" "Larry" "Curly"] [1 2 3])) ; -> same
~~~~

### Proxies

The `proxy` macro expands to code that creates a Java object that
extends a given Java class and/or implements zero or more Java
interfaces. This is often needed to implement callback methods in
listener objects that must implement a certain interface in order to
register for notifications from another object. For an example, see the
"[Desktop Applications](#DesktopApps)" section near the end of this
article. It creates an object that extends the JFrame GUI class and
implements the ActionListener interface.

### Threads

All Clojure functions implement both the ` java.lang.Runnable` interface
and the ` java.util.concurrent.Callable` interface. This makes it easy
to execute them in new Java threads. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn delayed-print [ms text]
  (Thread/sleep ms)
  (println text))

; Pass an anonymous function that invokes delayed-print
; to the Thread constructor so the delayed-print function
; executes inside the Thread instead of
; while the Thread object is being created.
(.start (Thread. #(delayed-print 1000 ", World!"))) ; prints 2nd
(print "Hello") ; prints 1st
; output is "Hello, World!"

### Exception Handling

All exceptions thrown by Clojure code are runtime exceptions. Java
methods invoked from Clojure code can still throw checked exceptions.
The `try`, `catch`, `finally` and `throw` special forms provide
functionality similar to their Java counterparts. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
 (defn collection? [obj]
  (println "obj is a" (class obj))
  ; Clojure collections implement clojure.lang.IPersistentCollection.
  (or (coll? obj) ; Clojure collection?
      (instance? java.util.Collection obj))) ; Java collection?

(defn average [coll]
  (when-not (collection? coll)
    (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "expected a collection")))
  (when (empty? coll)
    (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "collection is empty")))
  ; Apply the + function to all the items in coll,
  ; then divide by the number of items in it.
  (let [sum (apply + coll)]
    (/ sum (count coll))))

(try
  (println "list average =" (average '(2 3))) ; result is a clojure.lang.Ratio object
  (println "vector average =" (average [2 3])) ; same
  (println "set average =" (average #{2 3})) ; same
  (let [al (java.util.ArrayList.)]
    (doto al (.add 2) (.add 3))
    (println "ArrayList average =" (average al))) ; same
  (println "string average =" (average "1 2 3 4")) ; illegal argument
  (catch IllegalArgumentException e
    (println e)
    ;(.printStackTrace e) ; if a stack trace is desired
  )
  (finally
    (println "in finally")))
~~~~

The output produced by the code above follows:

~~~~
obj is a clojure.lang.PersistentList
list average = 5/2
obj is a clojure.lang.LazilyPersistentVector
vector average = 5/2
obj is a clojure.lang.PersistentHashSet
set average = 5/2
obj is a java.util.ArrayList
ArrayList average = 5/2
obj is a java.lang.String
#<IllegalArgumentException java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
expected a collection>
in finally
~~~~

Conditional Processing
----------------------

The `if` special form tests a condition and executes one of two
expressions based on whether the condition evaluates to true. Its syntax
is `(if condition then-expr else-expr)`. The else expression is
optional. If more than one expression is needed for the then or else
part, use the `do` special form to wrap them in a single expression. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(import '(java.util Calendar GregorianCalendar))
(let [gc (GregorianCalendar.)
      day-of-week (.get gc Calendar/DAY_OF_WEEK)
      is-weekend (or (= day-of-week Calendar/SATURDAY) (= day-of-week Calendar/SUNDAY))]
  (if is-weekend
    (println "play")
    (do (println "work")
        (println "sleep"))))
~~~~

The `when` and `when-not` macros provide alternatives to `if` when only
one branch is needed. Any number of body expressions can be supplied
without wrapping them in a `do`. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(when is-weekend (println "play"))
(when-not is-weekend (println "work") (println "sleep"))
~~~~

The `if-let` macro binds a value to a single binding and chooses an
expression to evaluate based on whether the value is logically true or
false (explained in the "[Predicates](#Predicates)" section). The
following code prints the name of the first person waiting in line or
prints "no waiting" if the line is empty.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn process-next [waiting-line]
  (if-let [name (first waiting-line)]
    (println name "is next")
    (println "no waiting")))

(process-next '("Jeremy" "Amanda" "Tami")) ; -> Jeremy is next
(process-next '()) ; -> no waiting
~~~~

The `when-let` macro is similar to the `if-let` macro, but it differs in
the same way that `if` differs from `when`. It doesn't support an else
part and the then part can contain any number of expressions. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn summarize
  "prints the first item in a collection
  followed by a period for each remaining item"
  [coll]
  ; Execute the when-let body only if the collection isn't empty.
  (when-let [head (first coll)]
    (print head)
    ; Below, dec subtracts one (decrements) from
    ; the number of items in the collection.
    (dotimes [_ (dec (count coll))] (print \.))
    (println)))

(summarize ["Moe" "Larry" "Curly"]) ; -> Moe..
(summarize []) ; -> no output
~~~~

The `condp` macro is similar to a case statement in other languages. It
takes a two parameter predicate (often `=` or `instance?`) and an
expression to act as its second argument. After those it takes any
number of value/result expression pairs that are evaluated in order. If
the predicate evaluates to true when one of the values is used as its
first argument then the corresponding result is returned. An optional
final argument specifies the result to be returned if no given value
causes the predicate to evaluate to true. If this is omitted and no
given value causes the predicate to evaluate to true then an
`IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

The following example prompts the user to enter a number and prints the
name of that number only for 1, 2 and 3. Otherwise, it prints
"unexpected value". After that, it examines the type of the local
binding "value". If it is a `Number`, it prints the number times two. If
it is a `String`, it prints the length of the string times two.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(print "Enter a number: ") (flush) ; stays in a buffer otherwise
(let [reader (java.io.BufferedReader. *in*) ; stdin
      line (.readLine reader)
      value (try
              (Integer/parseInt line)
              (catch NumberFormatException e line))] ; use string value if not integer
  (println
    (condp = value
      1 "one"
      2 "two"
      3 "three"
      (str "unexpected value, \"" value \")))
  (println
    (condp instance? value
      Number (* value 2)
      String (* (count value) 2))))
~~~~

The `cond` macro takes any number of predicate/result expression pairs.
It evaluates the predicates in order until one evaluates to true and
then returns the corresponding result. If none evaluate to true then an
`IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. Often the predicate in the last
pair is simply `true` to handle all remaining cases.

The following example prompts the user to enter a water temperature. It
then prints whether the water is freezing, boiling or neither.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(print "Enter water temperature in Celsius: ") (flush)
(let [reader (java.io.BufferedReader. *in*)
      line (.readLine reader)
      temperature (try
        (Float/parseFloat line)
        (catch NumberFormatException e line))] ; use string value if not float
  (println
    (cond
      (instance? String temperature) "invalid temperature"
      (<= temperature 0) "freezing"
      (>= temperature 100) "boiling"
      true "neither")))
~~~~

Iteration
---------

There are many ways to "loop" or iterate through items in a sequence.

The `dotimes` macro executes the expressions in its body a given number
of times, assigning values from zero to one less than that number to a
specified local binding. If the binding isn't needed (`card-number` in
the example below), an underscore can be used as its placeholder. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(dotimes [card-number 3]
  (println "deal card number" (inc card-number))) ; adds one to card-number
~~~~

Note that the `inc` function is used so that the values 1, 2 and 3 are
output instead of 0, 1 and 2. The code above produces the following
output:

~~~~
deal card number 1
deal card number 2
deal card number 3
~~~~

The `while` macro executes the expressions in its body while a test
expression evaluates to true. The following example executes the `while`
body while a given thread is still running:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn my-fn [ms]
  (println "entered my-fn")
  (Thread/sleep ms)
  (println "leaving my-fn"))

(let [thread (Thread. #(my-fn 1))]
  (.start thread)
  (println "started thread")
  (while (.isAlive thread)
    (print ".")
    (flush))
  (println "thread stopped"))
~~~~

The output from the code above will be similar to the following:

~~~~
started thread
.....entered my-fn.
.............leaving my-fn.
thread stopped
~~~~

### List Comprehension

The `for` and `doseq` macros perform list comprehension. They support
iterating through multiple collections (rightmost collection fastest)
and optional filtering using `:when` and `:while` expressions. The `for`
macro takes a single expression body and returns a lazy sequence of the
results. The `doseq` macro takes a body containing any number of
expressions, executes them for their side effects, and returns `nil`.

The following examples both output names of some spreadsheet cells
working down rows and then across columns. They skip the "B" column and
only use rows that are less than 3. Note how the `dorun` function,
described later in the "[Sequences](#Sequences)" section, is used to
force evaluation of the lazy sequence returned by the `for` macro.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def cols "ABCD")
(def rows (range 1 4)) ; purposely larger than needed to demonstrate :while

(println "for demo")
(dorun
  (for [col cols :when (not= col \B)
        row rows :while (< row 3)]
    (println (str col row))))

(println "\ndoseq demo")
(doseq [col cols :when (not= col \B)
        row rows :while (< row 3)]
  (println (str col row)))
~~~~

The code above produces the following output:

~~~~
for demo
A1
A2
C1
C2
D1
D2

doseq demo
A1
A2
C1
C2
D1
D2
~~~~

The `loop` special form, as its name suggests, supports looping. It and
its companion special form `recur` are described in the next section.

Recursion
---------

Recursion occurs when a function invokes itself either directly or
indirectly through another function that it calls. Common ways in which
recursion is terminated include checking for a collection of items to
become empty or checking for a number to reach a specific value such as
zero. The former case is often implemented by successively using the
`next` function to process all but the first item. The latter case is
often implemented by decrementing a number with the `dec` function.

Recursive calls can result in running out of memory if the call stack
becomes too deep. Some programming languages address this by supporting
"[tail call optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)"
(TCO). Java doesn't currently support TCO and neither does Clojure. One
way to avoid this issue in Clojure is to use the `loop` and `recur`
special forms. Another way is to use the
[trampoline](http://clojure.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/trampoline)
function.

The `loop`/`recur` idiom turns what looks like a recursive call into a
loop that doesn't consume stack space. The `loop` special form is like
the `let` special form in that they both establish local bindings, but
it also establishes a recursion point that is the target of calls to
`recur`. The bindings specified by `loop` provide initial values for the
local bindings. Calls to `recur` cause control to return to the `loop`
and assign new values to its local bindings. The number of arguments
passed to `recur` must match the number of bindings in the `loop`. Also,
`recur` can only appear as the last call in the `loop`.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn factorial-1 [number]
  "computes the factorial of a positive integer
   in a way that doesn't consume stack space"
  (loop [n number factorial 1]
    (if (zero? n)
      factorial
      (recur (dec n) (* factorial n)))))

(println (time (factorial-1 5))) ; -> "Elapsed time: 0.071 msecs"\n120
~~~~

The `defn` macro, like the `loop` special form, establishes a recursion
point. The `recur` special form can also be used as the last call in a
function to return to the beginning of that function with new arguments.

Another way to implement the factorial function is to use the `reduce`
function. This was described back in the "[Collections](#reduce)"
section. It supports a more functional, less imperative style.
Unfortunately, in this case, it is less efficient. Note that the `range`
function takes a lower bound that is inclusive and an upper bound that
is exclusive.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn factorial-2 [number] (reduce * (range 2 (inc number))))

(println (time (factorial-2 5))) ; -> "Elapsed time: 0.335 msecs"\n120
~~~~

The same result can be obtained by replacing `reduce` with `apply,` but
that takes even longer. This illustrates the importance of understanding
the characteristics of functions when choosing between them.

The `recur` special form isn't suitable for mutual recursion where a
function calls another function which calls back to the original
function. The ` trampoline` function, not covered here, does support
mutual recursion.

Predicates
----------

Clojure provides many functions that act as predicates, used to test a
condition. They return a value that can be interpreted as true or false.
The values `false` and `nil` are interpreted as false. The value `true`
and every other value, including zero, are interpreted as true.
Predicate functions usually have a name that ends in a question mark.

Reflection involves obtaining information about an object other than its
value, such as its type. There are many predicate functions that perform
reflection. Predicate functions that test the type of a single object
include `class?`, `coll?`, `decimal?`, `delay?`, `float?`, `fn?`,
`instance?`, `integer?`, `isa?`, `keyword?`, `list?`, `macro?`, `map?`,
`number?`, `seq?`, `set?`, `string?` and `vector?`. Some non-predicate
functions that perform reflection include `ancestors`, `bases`, `class`,
`ns-publics` and `parents`.

Predicate functions that test relationships between values include `<`,
`<=`, `=`, `not=`, `==`, `>`, `>=`, `compare`, `distinct?` and
`identical?`.

Predicate functions that test logical relationships include `and`, `or`,
`not`, `true?`, `false?` and `nil?`

Predicate functions that test sequences, most of which were discussed
earlier, include `empty?`, `not-empty`, `every?`, `not-every?`, `some`
and `not-any?`.

Predicate functions that test numbers include `even?`, `neg?`, `odd?`,
`pos?` and `zero?`.

Sequences
---------

Sequences are logical views of collections. Many things can be treated
as sequences. These include Java collections, Clojure-specific
collections, strings, streams, directory structures and XML trees.

Many Clojure functions return a lazy sequence. This is a sequence whose
items can be the result of function calls that aren't evaluated until
they are needed. A benefit of creating a lazy sequence is that it isn't
necessary to anticipate how many items in it will actually be used at
the time the sequence is created. Examples of functions and macros that
return lazy sequences include: `cache-seq`, `concat`, `cycle`,
`distinct`, `drop`, `drop-last`, `drop-while`, `filter`, `for`,
`interleave`, `interpose`, `iterate`, `lazy-cat`, `lazy-seq`,
`line-seq`, `map`, `partition`, `range`, `re-seq`, `remove`, `repeat`,
`replicate`, `take`, `take-nth`, `take-while` and `tree-seq`.

Lazy sequences are a common source of confusion for new Clojure
developers. For example, what does the following code output?

~~~~ {.clojure}
(map #(println %) [1 2 3])
~~~~

When run in a REPL, this outputs the values 1, 2 and 3 on separate lines
interspersed with a sequence of three `nil`s which are the return values
from three calls to the `println` function. The REPL always fully
evaluates the results of the expressions that are entered. However, when
run as part of a script, nothing is output by this code. This is because
the `map` function returns a lazy sequence containing the results of
applying its first argument function to each of the items in its second
argument collection. The documentation string for the `map` function
clearly states that it returns a lazy sequence.

There are many ways to force the evaluation of items in a lazy sequence.
Functions that extract a single item such as `first`, `second`, `nth`
and `last` do this. The items in the sequence are evaluated in order, so
items before the one requested are also evaluated. For example,
requesting the last item causes every item to be evaluated.

If the head of a lazy sequence is held in a binding, once an item has
been evaluated its value is cached so it isn't reevaluated if requested
again.

The `dorun` and `doall` functions force the evaluation of items in a
single lazy sequence. The `doseq` macro, discussed earlier in the
"[Iteration](#Iteration)" section, forces the evaluation of items in one
or more lazy sequences. The `for` macro, discussed in that same section,
does not force evaluation and instead returns another lazy sequence.

Using `doseq` or `dorun` is appropriate when the goal is to simply cause
the side effects of the evaluations to occur. The results of the
evaluations are not retained, so less memory is consumed. They both
return `nil`. Using `doall` is appropriate when the evaluation results
need to be retained. It holds the head of the sequence which causes the
results to be cached and it returns the evaluated sequence.

The table below illustrates the options for forcing the evaluation of
items in a lazy sequence.

Retain evaluation results

Discard evaluation results\
 and only cause side effects

Operate on a single sequence

`doall`

`dorun`

Operate on any number of sequences\
 with list comprehension syntax

N/A

`doseq`

The `doseq` macro is typically preferred over the `dorun` function
because the code is easier to read. It is also faster because a call to
`map` inside `dorun` creates another sequence. For example, the
following lines both produce the same output:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(dorun (map #(println %) [1 2 3]))
(doseq [i [1 2 3]] (println i))
~~~~

If a function creates a lazy sequence that will have side effects when
its items are evaluated, in most cases it should force the evaluation of
the sequence with `doall` and return its result. This makes the timing
of the side effects more predictable. Otherwise callers could evaluate
the lazy sequence any number of times resulting in the side effects
being repeated.

The following expressions all output 1, 2, 3 on separate lines, but they
have different return values. The `do` special form is used here to
implement an anonymous function that does more than one thing, print the
value passed in and return it.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(doseq [item [1 2 3]] (println item)) ; -> nil
(dorun (map #(println %) [1 2 3])) ; -> nil
(doall (map #(do (println %) %) [1 2 3])) ; -> (1 2 3)
~~~~

Lazy sequences make it possible to create infinite sequences since all
the items don't need to be evaluated. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn f
  "square the argument and divide by 2"
  [x]
  (println "calculating f of" x)
  (/ (* x x) 2.0))

; Create an infinite sequence of results from the function f
; for the values 0 through infinity.
; Note that the head of this sequence is being held in the binding "f-seq".
; This will cause the values of all evaluated items to be cached.
(def f-seq (map f (iterate inc 0)))

; Force evaluation of the first item in the infinite sequence, (f 0).
(println "first is" (first f-seq)) ; -> 0.0

; Force evaluation of the first three items in the infinite sequence.
; Since the (f 0) has already been evaluated,
; only (f 1) and (f 2) will be evaluated.
(doall (take 3 f-seq))

(println (nth f-seq 2)) ; uses cached result -> 2.0
~~~~

Here's a variation on the previous code that does not hold the head of
the lazy sequence in a binding. Note how the sequence is defined as the
result of a function rather than the value of a binding. The results for
evaluated items are not cached. This reduces memory requirements, but is
less efficient when items are requested more than once.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn f-seq [] (map f (iterate inc 0)))
(println (first (f-seq))) ; evaluates (f 0), but doesn't cache result
(println (nth (f-seq) 2)) ; evaluates (f 0), (f 1) and (f 2)
~~~~

Another way to avoid holding the head of a lazy sequence in a binding is
to pass the lazy sequence directly to a function that will evaluate its
items. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn consumer [seq]
  ; Since seq is a local binding, the evaluated items in it
  ; are cached while in this function and then garbage collected.
  (println (first seq)) ; evaluates (f 0)
  (println (nth seq 2))) ; evaluates (f 1) and (f 2)

(consumer (map f (iterate inc 0)))
~~~~

Input/Output
------------

Clojure provides a minimal set of functions that perform I/O operations.
Since Java classes are easy to use from Clojure code, the classes in the
`java.io` package can be used directly. However, the clojure.java.io
library makes many uses of those classes easier.

The predefined, special symbols `*in*`, `*out*` and `*err*` are set to
stdin, stdout and stderr by default. To flush buffered output in
`*out*`, use `(flush)` which is the same as `(.flush *out*)`. The
bindings for these symbols can be modified. For example, to redirect
output that goes to stdout by default so it goes to a file named
"`my.log`", surround the code to be affected as follows:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(binding [*out* (java.io.FileWriter. "my.log")]
  ...
  (println "This goes to the file my.log.")
  ...
  (flush))
~~~~

The `print` function prints the string representation of any number of
objects, with a space between each one, to the stream in the special
symbol `*out*`.

The `println` function is like `print`, but it outputs a newline
character at the end. By default, it also flushes its output. This can
be changed by binding the special symbol `*flush-on-newline*` to
`false`.

The `newline` function writes a newline character to the stream in
`*out*` . Calling `print` followed by `newline` is equivalent to
`println`.

The `pr` and `prn` functions are like their `print` and `println`
counterparts, but their output is in a form that can be read by the
Clojure reader. They are suitable for serializing Clojure data
structures. By default, they do not print metadata. This can be changed
by binding the special symbol `*print-meta*` to `true`.

The following examples demonstrate all four of the printing functions.
Note how the output for strings and characters differs depending on
whether the `print` or `pr` functions are used.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(let [obj1 "foo"
      obj2 {:letter \a :number (Math/PI)}] ; a map
  (println "Output from print:")
  (print obj1 obj2)

  (println "Output from println:")
  (println obj1 obj2)

  (println "Output from pr:")
  (pr obj1 obj2)

  (println "Output from prn:")
  (prn obj1 obj2))
~~~~

The code above produces the following output:

~~~~
Output from print:
foo {:letter a, :number 3.141592653589793}Output from println:
foo {:letter a, :number 3.141592653589793}
Output from pr:
"foo" {:letter \a, :number 3.141592653589793}Output from prn:
"foo" {:letter \a, :number 3.141592653589793}
~~~~

All the printing functions discussed above add a space between the
output of their arguments. The `str` function can be used to avoid this.
It concatenates the string representations of its arguments. For
example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(println "foo" 19) ; -> foo 19
(println (str "foo" 19)) ; -> foo19
~~~~

The `print-str`, `println-str`, `pr-str` and `prn-str` functions are
similar to their `print`, `println`, `pr` and `prn` counterparts, but
they print to a string that is returned instead of printing to `*out*`.

The `printf` function is similar to `print`, but uses a format string.
The `format` function is similar to `printf`, but prints to a string
that is returned instead of printing to `*out*`.

The `with-out-str` macro captures the output from all the expressions in
its body in a string and returns it.

The `with-open` macro takes any number of bindings to objects on which
`.close` should be called after the expressions in its body are
executed. It is ideal for processing resources such as files and
database connections.

The `line-seq` function takes a `java.io.BufferedReader` and returns a
lazy sequence of all the lines of text in it. The significance of
returning a "lazy" sequence is that it doesn't really read all of the
lines when it is called. That could consume too much memory. Instead it
reads a line each time one is requested from the lazy sequence.

The following example demonstrates both `with-open` and `line-seq`. It
reads all the lines in a file and prints those that contain a given
word.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(use '[clojure.java.io :only (reader)])

(defn print-if-contains [line word]
  (when (.contains line word) (println line)))

(let [file "story.txt"
      word "fur"]

  ; with-open will close the reader after
  ; evaluating all the expressions in its body.
  (with-open [rdr (reader file)]
    (doseq [line (line-seq rdr)] (print-if-contains line word))))
~~~~

The `slurp` function reads the entire contents of a file into a string
and returns it. The `spit` function writes a string to a given file and
closes it.

This article only scratches the surface of what the core and java.io
libraries provide. It's a worthwhile investment to read through the file
`clojure/java/io.clj` to learn about the other functions it defines.

Destructuring
-------------

Destructuring can be used in the parameter list of a function or macro
to extract parts of collections into local bindings. It can also be used
in bindings created using the `let` special form and the `binding`
macro.

For example, suppose we want a function that takes a list or vector and
returns the sum of its first and third items.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn approach1 [numbers]
  (let [n1 (first numbers)
        n3 (nth numbers 2)]
    (+ n1 n3)))

; Note the underscore used to represent the
; second item in the collection which isn't used.
(defn approach2 [[n1 _ n3]] (+ n1 n3))

(approach1 [4 5 6 7]) ; -> 10
(approach2 [4 5 6 7]) ; -> 10
~~~~

The ampersand character can be used with destructuring to capture the
remaining items in a collection. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn name-summary [[name1 name2 & others]]
  (println (str name1 ", " name2) "and" (count others) "others"))

(name-summary ["Moe" "Larry" "Curly" "Shemp"]) ; -> Moe, Larry and 2 others
~~~~

The `:as` keyword can be used to retain access to the entire collection
that is being destructured. Suppose we want a function that takes a list
or vector and returns the sum of the first and third items divided by
the sum of all the items.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn first-and-third-percentage [[n1 _ n3 :as coll]]
  (/ (+ n1 n3) (apply + coll)))

(first-and-third-percentage [4 5 6 7]) ; ratio reduced from 10/22 -> 5/11
~~~~

Destructuring can also be used to extract values from maps. Suppose we
want a function that takes a map of sales figures where each key is a
month and each value is the sales total for that month. The function
sums the sales for summer months and divides by the sales for all the
months to determine the percentage of all sales that occurred in the
summer.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn summer-sales-percentage
  ; The keywords below indicate the keys whose values
  ; should be extracted by destructuring.
  ; The non-keywords are the local bindings
  ; into which the values are placed.
  [{june :june july :july august :august :as all}]
  (let [summer-sales (+ june july august)
        all-sales (apply + (vals all))]
    (/ summer-sales all-sales)))

It is common when destructuring maps to use local binding names whose
names match corresponding keys. For example, in the code above we used
`{june :june july :july august :august :as all}`. This can be simplified
using `:keys`. For example, `{:keys [june july august] :as all}`.

Namespaces
----------

Java groups methods in classes and classes in packages. Clojure groups
things that are named by symbols in namespaces. These include Vars,
Refs, Atoms, Agents, functions, macros and namespaces themselves.

Symbols are used to assign names to functions, macros and bindings.
Symbols are partitioned into namespaces. There is always a current
default namespace, initially set to "user", and it is stored in the
special symbol `*ns*`. The default namespace can be changed in two ways.
The `in-ns` function merely changes it. The `ns` macro does that and
much more. One extra thing it does is make all the symbols in the
`clojure.core` namespace available in the new namespace (using `refer`
which is described later). Other features of the `ns` macro are
described later.

The "user" namespace provides access to all the symbols in the
`clojure.core` namespace. The same is true of any namespace that is made
the default through use of the `ns` macro.

In order to access items that are not in the default namespace they must
be namespace-qualified. This is done by preceding a name with a
namespace name and a slash. For example, the clojure.string library
defines the `join` function. It creates a string by concatenating a
given separator string between the string representation of all the
items in a sequence. The namespace-qualified name of this function is
`clojure.string/join`.

The `require` function loads Clojure libraries. It takes one or more
quoted namespace names. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(require 'clojure.string)
~~~~

This merely loads the library. Names in it must still be
namespace-qualified in order to refer to them. Note that namespace names
are separated from a name with a slash, whereas Java package names are
separated from a class name with a period. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(clojure.string/join "$" [1 2 3]) ; -> "1$2$3"
~~~~

The `alias` function creates an alias for a namespace to reduce the
amount of typing required to namespace-qualify symbols. Aliases are
defined and only known within the current namespace. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(alias 'su 'clojure.string)
(su/join "$" [1 2 3]) ; -> "1$2$3"
~~~~

The `refer` function makes all the symbols in a given namespace
accessible in the current namespace without namespace-qualifying them.
An exception is thrown if a name in the given namespace is already
defined in the current namespace. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(refer 'clojure.string)
~~~~

Now the previous code can be written as:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(join "$" [1 2 3]) ; -> "1$2$3"
~~~~

The combination of `require` and `refer` is used often, so the shortcut
function `use` is provided to do both.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(use 'clojure.string)
~~~~

The `ns` macro, mentioned earlier, changes the default namespace. It is
typically used at the top of a source file. It supports the directives
`:require`, `:use` and `:import` (for importing Java classes) that are
alternatives to using their function forms. Using these is preferred
over using their function forms. In the example below, note the use of
`:as` to create an alias for a namespace. Also note the use of `:only`
to load only part of a Clojure library.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(ns com.ociweb.demo
  (:require [clojure.string :as su])
  ; assumes this dependency: [org.clojure/math.numeric-tower "0.0.1"]
  (:use [clojure.math.numeric-tower :only (gcd, sqrt)])
  (:import (java.text NumberFormat) (javax.swing JFrame JLabel)))

(println (su/join "$" [1 2 3])) ; -> 1$2$3
(println (gcd 27 72)) ; -> 9
(println (sqrt 5)) ; -> 2.23606797749979
(println (.format (NumberFormat/getInstance) Math/PI)) ; -> 3.142
    
; See the screenshot that follows this code.
(doto (JFrame. "Hello")
  (.add (JLabel. "Hello, World!"))
  (.pack)
  (.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame/EXIT_ON_CLOSE)
  (.setVisible true))
~~~~

![Swing demo](images/SwingDemo.png)

The `create-ns` function creates a new namespace, but doesn't make it
the default. The `def` function defines a symbol in the default
namespace with an optional initial value. The `intern` function defines
a symbol in a given namespace (if the symbol doesn't already exist) and
optionally gives it an initial value. Note that the symbol name needs to
be quoted for `intern`, but not for `def`. This is because `def` is a
special form that doesn't evaluate all of its arguments, whereas
`intern` is a function, which means it evaluates all of its arguments.
For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def foo 1)
(create-ns 'com.ociweb.demo)
(intern 'com.ociweb.demo 'foo 2)
(println (+ foo com.ociweb.demo/foo)) ; -> 3
~~~~

The `ns-interns` function returns a map containing all the symbols
defined in a given, currently loaded namespace. The map has keys that
are `Symbol` objects for the names and values which are `Var` objects
representing functions, macros and bindings. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(ns-interns 'clojure.math.numeric-tower)
~~~~

The `all-ns` function returns a sequence of the currently loaded
namespaces. The following namespaces are loaded by default when a
Clojure program is run: `clojure.core`, `clojure.main`, `clojure.set`,
`clojure.xml`, `clojure.zip` and `user`. The following additional
namespaces are loaded by default in a REPL: `clojure.repl` and
`clojure.java.javadoc`.

The `namespace` function returns the namespace of a given symbol or
keyword.

Other namespace related functions not discussed here include
`ns-aliases`, `ns-imports`, `ns-map`, `ns-name`, `ns-publics`,
`ns-refers`, `ns-unalias`, `ns-unmap` and `remove-ns`.

### Some Fine Print

A `Symbol` object has a `String` name and a `String` namespace name
(called `ns`), but no value. The fact that it uses a String namespace
name instead of a `Namespace` object reference allows it to be in a
namespace that doesn't yet exist. A `Var` objects has references to a
`Symbol` object (called `sym`), a `Namespace` object (called `ns`) and
an `Object` object which is its "root value" (called `root`).
`Namespace` objects have a reference to a `Map` that holds associations
between `Symbol` objects and `Var` objects (named `mappings`). They also
have a reference to a `Map` that holds associations between `Symbol`
aliases and `Namespace` objects (called `namespaces`). See the class
diagram below which shows a small subset of the attributes and key
relationships between the Java classes and interfaces in the Clojure
implementation. In Clojure, the term "interning" typically refers to
adding a `Symbol`-to-`Var` mapping to a `Namespace`.

![class diagram](images/ClassDiagram.png)

Metadata
--------

Clojure metadata is data attached to a symbol or collection that is not
related to its logical value. Two objects that are logically equal, such
as two cards that are both the king of clubs, can have different
metadata. For example, metadata can be used to indicate whether a card
is bent. For the purpose of most card games, the fact that a card is
bent has no bearing on the value of the card.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defstruct card-struct :rank :suit)

(def card1 (struct card-struct :king :club))
(def card2 (struct card-struct :king :club))

(println (== card1 card2)) ; same identity? -> false
(println (= card1 card2)) ; same value? -> true

(def card2 ^{:bent true} card2) ; adds metadata at read-time
(def card2 (with-meta card2 {:bent true})) ; adds metadata at run-time
(println (meta card1)) ; -> nil
(println (meta card2)) ; -> {:bent true}
(println (= card1 card2)) ; still same value despite metadata diff. -> true
~~~~

Some metadata names have a designated use in Clojure. `:private` has a
boolean value that indicates whether access to a Var is restricted to
the namespace in which it is defined. `:doc` is a documentation string
for a Var. `:test` has a boolean value that indicates whether a function
that takes no arguments is a test function.

`:tag` is a string class name or a `Class` object that describes the
Java type of a Var or the return type of a function. These are referred
to as "type hints". Providing them can improve performance. To see where
in your code Clojure is using reflection to determine types, and
therefore taking a performance hit, set the global variable
`*warn-on-reflection*` to `true`.

Some metadata is automatically attached to Vars by the Clojure compiler.
`:file` is the string name of the file that defines the Var. `:line` is
the integer line number within the file where the Var is defined.
`:name` is a `Symbol` that provides a name for the Var. `:ns` is a
`Namespace` object that describes the namespace in which the Var is
defined. `:macro` is a boolean that indicates whether a Var is a macro
as opposed to a function or binding. `:arglist` is a list of vectors
where each vector describes the names of the parameters a function
accepts. Recall that a function can have more than one parameter list
and body.

Functions and macros, both represented by a `Var` object, have
associated metadata. For example, enter the following in a REPL:
`(meta (var reverse))`. The output will be similar to the following, but
on a single line:

~~~~ {.clojure}
{
  :ns #<Namespace clojure.core>,
  :name reverse,
  :file "core.clj",
  :line 630,
  :arglists ([coll]),
  :doc "Returns a seq of the items in coll in reverse order. Not lazy."
}
~~~~

The `source` macro, in the clojure.repl library, uses this metadata to
retrieve the source code for a given function or macro. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(source reverse)
~~~~

The code above produces the following output:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn reverse
  "Returns a seq of the items in coll in reverse order. Not lazy."
  [coll]
    (reduce conj nil coll))
~~~~

Macros
------

Macros are used to add new constructs to the language. They are code
that generates code at read-time.

While functions always evaluate all their arguments, macros can decide
which of their arguments will be evaluated. This is important for
implementing forms like `(if condition then-expr else-expr)`. If the
condition is `true`, only the "then" expression should be evaluated. If
the condition is `false`, only the "else" expression should be
evaluated. This means that `if` cannot be implemented as a function (it
is in fact a special form, not a macro). Other forms that must be
implemented as macros for this reason include `and` and `or` because
they need to "short-circuit".

To determine whether a given operation is implemented as a function or a
macro, either enter `(doc name)` in a REPL or examine its metadata. If
it is a macro then the metadata will contain a `:macro` key with a value
of `true`. For example, to determine this for `and`, enter the following
code in a REPL:

~~~~ {.clojure}
((meta (var and)) :macro) ; long way -> true
(^#'and :macro) ; short way -> true
~~~~

Let's walk through some examples of writing and using macros. Suppose
there are many places in our code that need to take different actions
based on whether a number is really close to zero, negative or positive.
We want to avoid code duplication. This must be implemented as a macro
instead of a function because only one of the three actions should be
evaluated. The `defmacro` macro defines a macro.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defmacro around-zero [number negative-expr zero-expr positive-expr]
  `(let [number# ~number] ; so number is only evaluated once
    (cond
      (< (Math/abs number#) 1e-15) ~zero-expr 
      (pos? number#) ~positive-expr
      true ~negative-expr)))
~~~~

The Reader expands calls to the `around-zero` macro into a call to the
`let` special form. That contains a call to the `cond` function whose
arguments are its conditions and return values. The `let` special form
is used here for efficiency in the event that the first parameter,
`number`, is passed as an expression instead of a simple value. It
evaluates `number` once and then uses its value in two places within the
`cond`. The auto-gensym `number#` is used to generate a unique symbol
name so there is no chance the binding name can conflict with that of
another symbol. This enables the creation of [hygienic
macros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macros).

The back-quote (a.k.a. syntax quote) at the beginning of the macro
definition prevents everything inside from being evaluated unless it is
unquoted. This means the contents will appear literally in the
expansion, except items preceded by a tilde (in this case, `number`,
`zero-expr`, `positive-expr` and `negative-expr`). When a symbol name is
preceded by a tilde inside a syntax quoted list, its value is
substituted. Bindings in syntax quoted lists whose values are sequences
can be preceded by `~@` to substitute their individual items.

Here are two example uses of this macro where the expected output is
"`+`".

~~~~ {.clojure}
(around-zero 0.1 (println "-") (println "0") (println "+"))
(println (around-zero 0.1 "-" "0" "+")) ; same thing
~~~~

To execute more than one form for one of the cases, wrap them in a `do`
form. For example, if the number represented a temperature and we had a
`log` function to write to a log file, we might write this:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(around-zero 0.1
  (do (log "really cold!") (println "-"))
  (println "0")
  (println "+"))
~~~~

To verify that this macro is expanded properly, enter the following in a
REPL:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(macroexpand-1
  '(around-zero 0.1 (println "-") (println "0") (println "+")))
~~~~

This will output the following on a single line without the indentation:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(clojure.core/let [number__3382__auto__ 0.1]
  (clojure.core/cond
    (clojure.core/< (Math/abs number__3382__auto__) 1.0E-15) (println "0")
    (clojure.core/pos? number__3382__auto__) (println "+")
    true (println "-")))
~~~~

Here's a function that uses the macro to return a word describing a
number.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn number-category [number]
  (around-zero number "negative" "zero" "positive"))
~~~~

Here are some example uses.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(println (number-category -0.1)) ; -> negative
(println (number-category 0)) ; -> zero
(println (number-category 0.1)) ; -> positive
~~~~

Since macros don't evaluate their arguments, unquoted function names can
be passed to them and calls to the functions with arguments can be
constructed. Function definitions cannot do this and instead must be
passed anonymous functions that wrap calls to functions.

Here's a macro that takes two arguments. The first is a function that
expects one argument that is a number of radians, such as a trigonometry
function. The second is a number of degrees. If this were written as a
function instead of a macro, we would have to pass `#(Math/sin %)`
instead of simply `Math/sin` for the function. Note the use of the `#`
suffix to generate unique, local binding names. This is sometimes
necessary to avoid collisions with other bindings. Both `#` and `~` must
be used inside a syntax quoted list.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defmacro trig-y-category [fn degrees]
  `(let [radians# (Math/toRadians ~degrees)
         result# (~fn radians#)]
     (number-category result#)))
~~~~

Let's try it. The expected output from the code below is "zero",
"positive", "zero" and "negative".

~~~~ {.clojure}
(doseq [angle (range 0 360 90)] ; 0, 90, 180 and 270
  (println (trig-y-category Math/sin angle)))
~~~~

Macro names cannot be passed as arguments to functions. For example, a
macro name such as `and` cannot be passed to the `reduce` function. A
workaround is to define an anonymous function that calls the macro. For
example, `(fn [x y] (and x y))` or `#(and %1 %2)`. The macro is expanded
inside the anonymous function body at read-time. When this function is
passed to another function such as `reduce`, a function object rather
than a macro name is passed.

Macro calls are processed at read-time.

Concurrency
-----------

Wikipedia has a great definition of concurrency: "Concurrency is a
property of systems in which several computations are executing and
overlapping in time, and potentially interacting with each other. The
overlapping computations may be executing on multiple cores in the same
chip, preemptively time-shared threads on the same processor, or
executed on physically separated processors." The primary challenge of
concurrency is managing access to shared, mutable state.

Managing concurrency with locks is hard. It requires determining which
objects need to be locked and when they need to be locked. These
decisions need to be reevaluated when the code is modified or new code
is added. If a developer forgets to lock objects that need to be locked
or locks them at the wrong times, bad things can happen. These include
[deadlocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock) and [race
conditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). If objects are
locked unnecessarily, there is a performance penalty.

Support for concurrency is one of the main reasons why many developers
choose to use Clojure. All data is immutable unless explicitly marked as
mutable by using the reference types [Var](#Vars), [Ref](#Refs),
[Atom](#Atoms) and [Agent](#Agents). These provide safe ways to manage
shared state and are described in the next section titled "[Reference
Types](#ReferenceTypes)".

It is easy to run any Clojure function, including user-written functions
that are either named or anonymous, in a new thread. See the earlier
discussion on threads in the "[Java Interoperability](#Threads)"
section.

Since Clojure can use all Java classes and interfaces, it can use all
the Java concurrency capabilities. A great source of information on
these is the book "[Java Concurrency In Practice](http://jcip.net/)".
This book contains excellent advice for managing concurrency using Java,
but following the advice is not easy. In most cases, using Clojure
reference types is easier than using Java-based concurrency.

In addition to reference types, Clojure provides many functions that
assist with running code in different threads.

The `future` macro runs a body of expressions in a different thread
using one of the thread pools (`CachedThreadPool`) that are also used by
[Agents](#Agents) (described later). This is useful for long running
expressions whose results aren't needed immediately. The result is
obtained by dereferencing the object returned by `future`. If the body
hasn't yet completed when its result is requested, the current thread
blocks until it does. Since a thread from an Agent thread pool is used,
`shutdown-agents` should be called at some point so those threads are
stopped and the application can exit.

To demonstrate using `future`, a `println` was added to the `derivative`
function described at the end of the "[Defining
Functions](#polynomials)" section. It helps identify when that function
is executed. Note the order of the output from the code below:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(println "creating future")
(def my-future (future (f-prime 2))) ; f-prime is called in another thread
(println "created future")
(println "result is" @my-future)
(shutdown-agents)
~~~~

If the `f-prime` function doesn't complete quickly, the output from the
code above will be:

~~~~ {.clojure}
creating future
created future
derivative entered
result is 9.0
~~~~

The `pmap` function applies a function to all the items in a collection
in parallel. It provides better performance than the `map` function when
the function being applied is time consuming compared to the overhead of
managing the threads.

The `clojure.parallel` namespace provides many more functions that help
with parallelizing code. These include `par`, `pdistinct`,
`pfilter-dupes`, `pfilter-nils`, `pmax`, `pmin`, `preduce`, `psort`,
`psummary` and `pvec`.

Reference Types
---------------

Reference types are mutable references to immutable data. There are four
references types in Clojure: [Vars](#Vars), [Refs](#Refs),
[Atoms](#Atoms) and [Agents](#Agents). They have many things in common:

-   They can hold any kind of object.
-   They can be dereferenced to retrieve the object they hold with the
    `deref` function or the `@` reader macro.
-   They support validators which are functions that are invoked when
    the value changes. If the new value is valid, they return `true`.
    Otherwise they either return `false` or throw an exception. If they
    simply return `false`, an `IllegalStateException` with the message
    "Invalid reference state" will be thrown.
-   They support watchers which are Agents. When the value of a watched
    reference changes, the Agent is notified. For more detail, see the
    "[Agents](#Agents)" section.

The table below summarizes some of the differences between the four
reference types and the functions used to create and modify them. Each
of the functions in the table below are described later.

### Vars

[Vars](http://clojure.org/vars) are references that can have a root
binding that is shared by all threads and can have a different value in
each thread (thread-local).

To create a Var and give it a root binding:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def name value)
~~~~

Providing a value is optional. If none is given then the Var is said to
be "unbound". The same form is used to change the root binding of an
existing Var.

There are two ways to create a thread-local binding for an existing Var:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(binding [name expression] body)
(set! name expression) ; inside a binding that bound the same name
~~~~

Use of the [binding](#binding) macro was described earlier. The
following example demonstrates using it in conjunction with the `set!`
special form. That changes the thread-local value of a Var that was
bound to a thread-local value by the `binding` macro.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def v 1)

(defn change-it []
  (println "2) v =" v) ; -> 1

  (def v 2) ; changes root value
  (println "3) v =" v) ; -> 2

  (binding [v 3] ; binds a thread-local value
    (println "4) v =" v) ; -> 3

    (set! v 4) ; changes thread-local value
    (println "5) v =" v)) ; -> 4

  (println "6) v =" v)) ; thread-local value is gone now -> 2

(println "1) v =" v) ; -> 1

(let [thread (Thread. #(change-it))]
  (.start thread)
  (.join thread)) ; wait for thread to finish

(println "7) v =" v) ; -> 2
~~~~

The use of Vars is often frowned upon because changes to their values
are not coordinated across threads. For example, a thread A could use
the root value of a Var and then later discover that another thread B
changed that value before thread A finished executing.

### Refs

Refs are used to ensure that changes to one or more bindings are
coordinated between multiple threads. This coordination is implemented
using [Software Transactional
Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory)
(STM). Refs can only be modified inside a transaction.

STM has properties that are similar to database transactions. All
changes made inside an STM transaction only become visible to other
threads at a single point in time when the transaction commits. This
makes them both atomic and isolated. Validation functions make it
possible to insure that changes are consistent with the values of other
data.

Code to be executed inside a transaction appears inside the body of a
call to the `dosync` macro which demarcates the transaction. While
inside a transaction, Refs that are changed have a private,
in-transaction value that is not seen by other threads until the
transaction commits.

If no exceptions are thrown before the end of the transaction is reached
then changes to Refs made in the transaction are committed. This means
the in-transaction changes become visible outside the transaction.

If an exception is thrown from any code executed inside the transaction,
including those thrown from validation functions, the transaction rolls
back. This means the in-transaction changes are discarded.

While in a transaction, if an attempt is made to read or modify a Ref
that has been modified in another transaction that has committed since
the current transaction started (a conflict), the current transaction
will retry. This means it will discard all its in-transaction changes
and return to the beginning of the `dosync` body. There are no
guarantees about when a transaction will detect a conflict or when it
will begin a retry, only that they will be detected and retries will be
performed.

It is important that the code executed inside transactions be free of
side effects since it may be run multiple times due to these retries.
One way to support calls to functions that have side effects is to make
the calls in actions that are sent to agents from inside a transaction.
Those are held until the transaction completes. If the transaction
commits then the actions are sent once regardless of the number of
retries that occur. If the transaction rolls back then the actions are
not sent.

The `ref `function creates a new Ref object. One way to create a Ref and
retain access to it is to use the `def` special form.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def name (ref value))
~~~~

The `dosync `macro starts a transaction that continues while the
expressions in its body are evaluated. The `ref-set` function changes
the in-transaction value of a Ref and returns it. It must be called
inside a transaction, otherwise an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.
The change will only be visible outside the transaction if and when the
transaction commits. This happens when a `dosync` exits without an
exception being thrown. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(dosync
  ...
  (ref-set name new-value)
  ...)
~~~~

If the new value must be computed from the old value then three steps
are required.

1.  deference the Ref to get the old value
2.  compute the new value
3.  set the new value

The `alter` and `commute` functions perform these three steps as a
single operation. The `alter` function is used for changes that must be
made in a specific order. The `commute` function is used for changes
whose order is not important (i.e., commutative) and can be performed in
parallel. Like `ref-set`, both must be called inside a transaction. Both
take an "update function" that will compute the new value and additional
arguments to be passed to it. This function will be passed the current
in-transaction value of the Ref followed by the additional arguments, if
any. Whenever the new value is based on the old value (computed as a
function of the old value), using `alter` or `commute` is preferred over
`ref-set`.

For example, suppose we want to add one to the value of a Ref named
`counter`. This could be implemented as follows, using `inc` for the
update function:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(dosync
  ...
  (alter counter inc)
  ; or as
  (commute counter inc)
  ...)
~~~~

If an `alter` attempts to modify a Ref that has been changed by another
thread since the current transaction began, the current transaction will
retry from the beginning. Calls to `commute` do not do this. They
proceed through the current transaction using in-transaction values for
the Refs. This results in better performance because retries aren't
performed. Remember though that `commute` should only be used when the
order of the updates they make across multiple transactions are not
important.

If the transaction commits, something extra happens for the `commute`
calls that were made in the transaction. For each `commute` call, the
Ref they set will be reset using the result of the following call:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(apply update-function last-committed-value-of-ref args)
~~~~

Note that the update function will be passed the last committed value of
the Ref. This may be the result of a transaction that committed in
another thread after the current transaction began. It is not passed the
in-transaction value of the Ref from the current transaction.

Using `commute` instead of `alter` is an optimization. It will not
produce different end results unless the order of the updates really
does matter.

Let's walk through an example that uses both Refs and Atoms (which are
explained in more detail later). This example involves bank accounts and
their transactions. First we'll define the data model.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(ns com.ociweb.bank)

; Assume the only account data that can change is its balance.
(defstruct account-struct :id :owner :balance-ref)

; We need to be able to add and delete accounts to and from a map.
; We want it to be sorted so we can easily
; find the highest account number
; for the purpose of assigning the next one.
(def account-map-ref (ref (sorted-map)))
~~~~

The following function creates a new account saves it in the account
map, and returns it.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn open-account
  "creates a new account, stores it in the account map and returns it"
  [owner]
  (dosync ; required because a Ref is being changed
    (let [account-map @account-map-ref
          last-entry (last account-map)
          ; The id for the new account is one higher than the last one.
          id (if last-entry (inc (key last-entry)) 1)
          ; Create the new account with a zero starting balance.
          account (struct account-struct id owner (ref 0))]
      ; Add the new account to the map of accounts.
      (alter account-map-ref assoc id account)
      ; Return the account that was just created.
      account)))
~~~~

The following functions support depositing and withdrawing money to and
from an account.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn deposit [account amount]
  "adds money to an account; can be a negative amount"
  (dosync ; required because a Ref is being changed
    (Thread/sleep 50) ; simulate a long-running operation
    (let [owner (account :owner)
          balance-ref (account :balance-ref)
          type (if (pos? amount) "deposit" "withdraw")
          direction (if (pos? amount) "to" "from")
          abs-amount (Math/abs amount)]
      (if (>= (+ @balance-ref amount) 0) ; sufficient balance?
        (do
          (alter balance-ref + amount)
          (println (str type "ing") abs-amount direction owner))
        (throw (IllegalArgumentException.
                 (str "insufficient balance for " owner
                      " to withdraw " abs-amount)))))))

(defn withdraw
  "removes money from an account"
  [account amount]
  ; A withdrawal is like a negative deposit.
  (deposit account (- amount)))
~~~~

The following function supports transferring money from one account to
another. The transaction started by `dosync` ensures that either both
the withdrawal and the deposit occur or neither occurs.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn transfer [from-account to-account amount]
  (dosync
    (println "transferring" amount
             "from" (from-account :owner)
             "to" (to-account :owner))
    (withdraw from-account amount)
    (deposit to-account amount)))
~~~~

The following functions support reporting on the state of accounts. The
transaction started by `dosync` ensures that the report will be
consistent across accounts. For example, it won't report balances that
are the result of a half-completed transfer.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn- report-1 ; a private function
  "prints information about a single account"
  [account]
  ; This assumes it is being called from within
  ; the transaction started in report.
  (let [balance-ref (account :balance-ref)]
    (println "balance for" (account :owner) "is" @balance-ref)))

(defn report
  "prints information about any number of accounts"
  [& accounts]
  (dosync (doseq [account accounts] (report-1 account))))
~~~~

This code doesn't handle exceptions that occur within the threads it
starts. Instead we'll define an exception handler for them in the
current thread.

~~~~ {.clojure}
; Set a default uncaught exception handler
; to handle exceptions not caught in other threads.
(Thread/setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler
  (proxy [Thread$UncaughtExceptionHandler] []
    (uncaughtException [thread throwable]
      ; Just print the message in the exception.
      (println (.. throwable .getCause .getMessage)))))
~~~~

Now we're ready to exercise the functions defined above.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(let [a1 (open-account "Mark")
      a2 (open-account "Tami")
      thread (Thread. #(transfer a1 a2 50))]
  (try
    (deposit a1 100)
    (deposit a2 200)

    ; There are sufficient funds in Mark's account at this point
    ; to transfer $50 to Tami's account.
    (.start thread) ; will sleep in deposit function twice!

    ; Unfortunately, due to the time it takes to complete the transfer
    ; (simulated with sleep calls), the next call will complete first.
    (withdraw a1 75)

    ; Now there are insufficient funds in Mark's account
    ; to complete the transfer.

    (.join thread) ; wait for thread to finish
    (report a1 a2)
    (catch IllegalArgumentException e
      (println (.getMessage e) "in main thread"))))
~~~~

The output from the code above is:

~~~~
depositing 100 to Mark
depositing 200 to Tami
transferring 50 from Mark to Tami
withdrawing 75 from Mark
transferring 50 from Mark to Tami (a retry)
insufficient balance for Mark to withdraw 50
balance for Mark is 25
balance for Tami is 200
~~~~

### Validation Functions

Before moving on to discuss the next reference type, here's an example
of using a validation function to verify that all values assigned to a
Ref are integers.

~~~~ {.clojure}
; Note the use of the :validator directive when creating the Ref
; to assign a validation function which is integer? in this case.
(def my-ref (ref 0 :validator integer?))

(try
  (dosync
    (ref-set my-ref 1) ; works

    ; The next line doesn't work, so the transaction is rolled back
    ; and the previous change isn't committed.
    (ref-set my-ref "foo"))
  (catch IllegalStateException e
    ; do nothing
    ))

(println "my-ref =" @my-ref) ; due to validation failure -> 0
~~~~

### Atoms

Atoms provide a mechanism for updating a single value that is far
simpler than the combination of Refs and STM. They are not affected by
transactions.

There are three functions that change the value of an Atom, `reset!`,
`compare-and-set!` and `swap!`.

The `reset!` function takes the Atom to be set and the new value. It
sets the new value without considering the current value. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def my-atom (atom 1))
(reset! my-atom 2)
(println @my-atom) ; -> 2
~~~~

The `compare-and-set!` function takes the Atom to be set, what is
believed to be the current value, and the desired new value. If the
current value matches the second argument then it is changed to the new
value and `true` is returned. Otherwise the value remains unchanged and
`false` is returned. This is useful to avoid changing the value if some
other code has changed it since it was dereferenced at a particular
point.

The `compare-and-set!` function is typically used at the end of a
section of code where the beginning is a binding that captures the
dereferenced value of the Atom. The code in between can assume one of
two outcomes. One outcome is that the value of the Atom will remain
unchanged while this code executes and `compare-and-set!` will change it
at the end. The other outcome is that some other code will change the
value of the Atom while this code executes and `compare-and-set!` will
not change it at the end, returning `false` instead. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def my-atom (atom 1))

(defn update-atom []
  (let [curr-val @my-atom]
    (println "update-atom: curr-val =" curr-val) ; -> 1
    (Thread/sleep 50) ; give reset! time to run
    (println
      (compare-and-set! my-atom curr-val (inc curr-val))))) ; -> false

(let [thread (Thread. #(update-atom))]
  (.start thread)
  (Thread/sleep 25) ; give thread time to call update-atom
  (reset! my-atom 3) ; happens after update-atom binds curr-val
  (.join thread)) ; wait for thread to finish

(println @my-atom) ; -> 3
~~~~

Why is the output from this code 3? The `update-atom` function is called
in a separate thread before the `reset!` function. It captures the
current value of the Atom which is 1. Then it sleeps to give the
`reset!` function time to run. After that, the value of the Atom is 3.
When the `update-atom` function calls `compare-and-set!` to increment
the value, it fails because the current value is no longer 1. This means
the value of the Atom remains set to 3.

The `swap!` function takes an Atom to be set, a function to compute the
new value and any number of additional arguments to be passed to the
function. The function is called with the current value of the Atom and
the additional arguments, if any. It is essentially a wrapper around the
use of `compare-and-set!` with one important difference. It begins by
dereferencing the Atom to save its current value. Next, it calls the
function to compute the new value. Finally, it calls `compare-and-set!`
using the current value obtained at the beginning. If `compare-and-set!`
returns `false`, meaning the current value of the Atom didn't match its
value before the call to the function, **the function is called
repeatedly until this check succeeds**. This is the important
difference. The previous code can be written using `swap!` instead of
`compare-and-set!` as follows:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def my-atom (atom 1))

(defn update-atom [curr-val]
  (println "update-atom: curr-val =" curr-val)
  (Thread/sleep 50) ; give reset! time to run
  (inc curr-val))

(let [thread (Thread. #(swap! my-atom update-atom))]
  (.start thread)
  (Thread/sleep 25) ; give swap! time to call update-atom
  (reset! my-atom 3)
  (.join thread)) ; wait for thread to finish

(println @my-atom) ; -> 4
~~~~

Why is the output from this code 4? The `swap!` function is called in a
separate thread before the `reset!` function. When the `update-atom`
function is called from `swap!`, the current value of the Atom is 1.
However, due to the `sleep` call, it doesn't complete before `reset!` is
run, which sets the value to 3. The `update-atom` function returns 2.
Before `swap!` can set the Atom to 2 it needs to verify that its current
value is still 1. It isn't, so `swap!` calls `update-atom` again. This
time the current value is 3, so it increments that and returns 4. The
`swap!` function now successfully verifies that it knew the current
value before the last call to `update-atom` and it sets the Atom to 4.

### Agents

Agents are used to run tasks in separate threads that typically don't
require coordination. They are useful for modifying the state of a
single object which is the value of the agent. This value is changed by
running an "action" in a separate thread. An action is a function that
takes the current value of the Agent as its first argument and
optionally takes additional arguments. **Only one action at a time will
be run on a given Agent.**

The `agent` function creates a new Agent. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def my-agent (agent initial-value))
~~~~

The `send` function dispatches an action to an Agent and returns
immediately instead of waiting for the action to complete. The action is
executed in a thread from a supplied thread pool. When the action
completes, its return value will be assigned to the Agent. The
`send-off` function is similar, but uses threads from a different pool.

The `send` function uses a "fixed thread pool" (see the
[newFixedThreadPool](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newFixedThreadPool(int))
method in java.util.concurrent.Executors) where the number of threads is
the number of processors plus two. If all of those threads are busy, the
action doesn't run until one becomes available. The `send-off` function
uses a "cached thread pool" (see the
[newCachedThreadPool](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newCachedThreadPool())
method in java.util.concurrent.Executors) where existing threads in the
pool are used if available and new threads are added otherwise.

If the `send` or `send-off` functions are invoked from inside a
transaction, the action isn't actually sent until the transaction
commits. This is somewhat similar to calling the `commute` function on a
Ref in the sense that the calls that determine the value to retain occur
at the end of the transaction.

Inside actions, the Agent on which they are operating is bound to the
symbol `*agent*`.

The `await` function takes any number of Agents and blocks the current
thread until all actions that thread has dispatched to those Agents have
completed. The `await-for` function is similar, but takes a timeout in
milliseconds as its first argument. If the actions complete before the
timeout occurs, it returns a non-`nil` value. Otherwise it returns
`nil`. The `await` and `await-for` functions cannot be called inside a
transaction.

If an action throws an exception then dereferencing the Agent to which
it was sent will also throw an exception. The exceptions thrown in all
actions that have been sent to a given Agent can be retrieved by calling
the `agent-errors` function. The `clear-agent-errors` function clears
the collection of exceptions for a given Agent.

The `shutdown-agents` function waits for the execution of all actions
already sent to all Agents to complete. It then stops all the threads in
the thread pools that are used by Agents. After this has been called, no
new actions can be sent. Calling `shutdown-agents` is necessary to allow
the JVM to exit in an orderly manner because the threads in the Agent
thread pools are not daemon threads.

### Watchers

WARNING: This section needs to be updated for changes made in Clojure
1.1. The `add-watcher` and `remove-watcher` function have been removed.
The `add-watch` and `remove-watch` functions, that works differently,
have been added.

Agents can act as watchers of other reference type objects. After the
value of a watched reference has changed, the Agent is notified by
sending it an action. The type of the send, `send` or `send-off`, is
specified when the watcher is registered with a reference object. The
action function is passed the current value of the Agent (not the value
of the reference object that changed) and the reference object whose
state changed. The return value of the action function becomes the new
value of the Agent.

As stated earlier, functional programming emphasizes the use of "pure
functions" which have no side effects such as changing global state.
Clojure doesn't prevent functions from doing this, but it does make it
easy to find the functions that do. One way is to search the source code
for functions and macros that call any of the small set of functions
that change global state (for example, `alter`). Another way is to use
watchers to detect changes. A watcher could print a stack trace to
identify the function that made the change.

The example below registers a watcher Agent with a Var, a Ref and an
Atom. The state of the watcher Agent is a map that is used to count the
number of times each reference it is watching changes. The keys in this
map are the reference objects and the values are change counts.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(def my-watcher (agent {}))

(defn my-watcher-action [current-value reference]
  (let [change-count-map current-value
        old-count (change-count-map reference)
        new-count (if old-count (inc old-count) 1)]
  ; Return an updated map of change counts
  ; that will become the new value of the Agent.
  (assoc change-count-map reference new-count)))

(def my-var "v1")
(def my-ref (ref "r1"))
(def my-atom (atom "a1"))

(add-watcher (var my-var) :send-off my-watcher my-watcher-action)
(add-watcher my-ref :send-off my-watcher my-watcher-action)
(add-watcher my-atom :send-off my-watcher my-watcher-action)

; Change the root binding of the Var in two ways.
(def my-var "v2")
(alter-var-root (var my-var) (fn [curr-val] "v3"))

; Change the Ref in two ways.
(dosync
  ; The next line only changes the in-transaction value
  ; so the watcher isn't notified.
  (ref-set my-ref "r2")
  ; When the transaction commits, the watcher is
  ; notified of one change this Ref ... the last one.
  (ref-set my-ref "r3"))
(dosync
  (alter my-ref (fn [_] "r4"))) ; And now one more.

; Change the Atom in two ways.
(reset! my-atom "a2")
(compare-and-set! my-atom @my-atom "a3")

; Wait for all the actions sent to the watcher Agent to complete.
(await my-watcher)

; Output the number of changes to
; each reference object that was watched.
(let [change-count-map @my-watcher]
  (println "my-var changes =" (change-count-map (var my-var))) ; -> 2
  (println "my-ref changes =" (change-count-map my-ref)) ; -> 2
  (println "my-atom changes =" (change-count-map my-atom))) ; -> 2

(shutdown-agents)

Compiling
---------

When Clojure source files are executed as scripts, they are compiled to
Java bytecode at runtime. They can also be compiled to Java bytecode
ahead of time (AOT). This improves the startup time of Clojure
applications and produces .class files that can be used in Java
applications. Recommended steps to do this are:

1.  Select a namespace for the source files to be compiled, for example,
    `com.ociweb.talk`.
2.  Create directories named "`src`" and "`classes`" in the same parent
    directory.
3.  Make one of the source files have the same name as the last part of
    the namespace. We'll call this the main source file. For example,
    `talk.clj`.
4.  Place the source files under the "`src`" directory in a directory
    structure patterned after the namespace. For example, the main
    source would be `src/com/ociweb/talk.clj`.
5.  Specify the namespace at the top of the main source file and include
    the `:gen-class` namespace directive. For example:
    `(ns com.ociweb.talk (:gen-class))`
6.  In the main source file, use the `load` function to load all the
    other source files in the same namespace with relative paths. For
    example, if the file `more.clj` is in a subdirectory of
    `src/com/ociweb` named "`talk`", use `(load "talk/more")`.
7.  In each of the other source files, use the `in-ns` function to set
    their namespace. For example, add `(in-ns 'com.ociweb.talk)` to the
    top of `more.clj`.
8.  Add the "`src`" and "`classes`" directories to the classpath used by
    the REPL. If a script is used to run the REPL, modify that script.
9.  Start a REPL.
10. Use the `compile `function to compile all the source files in a
    given namespace by entering `(compile 'namespace)`. For example:
    `(compile 'com.ociweb.talk)`.

A separate .class file is produced for each function. They are written
under the "`classes`" directory in a directory structure that
corresponds to their namespace.

If the compiled namespace has a function named `-main`, it can be run as
a Java application. Command-line arguments are passed as arguments to
that function. For example, if `talk.clj` contained a `-main` function,
it could be run as follows:

~~~~ {.clojure}
java -classpath path/classes:path/clojure.jar com.ociweb.talk args
~~~~

### Java Calling Clojure

AOT compiled Clojure functions can be called from a Java application if
they are marked as static. To do this, set the metadata key `:static` to
`true` in the `:gen-class` `:methods` directive. The `:methods`
directive also specifies the Java types for the parameters and return
value. The syntax for this is:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(ns namespace
  (:gen-class
   :methods [^{:static true} [function-name [param-types] return-type]]))
~~~~

Let's walk through an example. Here's a Clojure source file named
`Demo.clj` in the directory `src/com/ociweb/clj`.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(ns com.ociweb.clj.Demo
  (:gen-class
   :methods [^{:static true} [getMessage [String] String]]))

# Note the hyphen at the beginning of the function name!
(defn -getMessage [name]
  (str "Hello, " name "!"))
~~~~

Here's a Java source file named `Main.java` that is in the same
directory as the `src` and `classes` directories.

~~~~ {.clojure}
import com.ociweb.clj.Demo; // class created by compiling Clojure source file

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = Demo.getMessage("Mark");
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
~~~~

Here are the steps to build and run it.

1.  cd to the directory containing the `src` and `classes` directories.
2.  Start a REPL by entering "`clj`".
3.  Enter "`(compile 'com.ociweb.clj.Demo)`".
4.  Exit the REPL (ctrl-d or ctrl-c).
5.  Enter "`javap -classpath classes com.ociweb.clj.Demo`" to see the
    methods in the generated class.
6.  Enter "`javac -cp classes Main.java`".
7.  Enter "`java -cp .:classes:path/clojure.jar Main.java`". Use
    semicolons instead of colons under Windows.
8.  The output should be "`Hello, Mark!`".

There are many more advanced compiling features. For more detail, see
the API documentation for the `gen-class` macro. Also see
[http://clojure.org/compilation/](http://clojure.org/compilation).

Automated Testing
-----------------

The primary automated testing framework for Clojure is the test library
included in Clojure core. The following code demonstrates its main
features:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(use 'clojure.test)

; Tests can be written in separate functions.
(deftest add-test
  ; The "is" macro takes a predicate, arguments to it,
  ; and an optional message.
  (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))
  (is (= 2 (+ 2 0)) "adding zero doesn't change value"))

(deftest reverse-test
  (is (= [3 2 1] (reverse [1 2 3]))))

; Tests can verify that a specific exception is thrown.
(deftest division-test
  (is (thrown? ArithmeticException (/ 3.0 0))))

; The with-test macro can be used to add tests
; to the functions they test as metadata.
(with-test
  (defn my-add [n1 n2] (+ n1 n2))
  (is (= 4 (my-add 2 2)))
  (is (= 2 (my-add 2 0)) "adding zero doesn't change value"))

; The "are" macro takes a predicate template and
; multiple sets of arguments to it, but no message.
; Each set of arguments are substituted one at a time
; into the predicate template and evaluated.
(deftest multiplication
  (are [n1 n2 result]
    (= (* n1 n2) result) ; a template
    1 1 1,
    1 2 2,
    2 3 6))

; Run all the tests in the current namespace.
; This includes tests that were added as function metadata using with-test.
; Other namespaces can be specified as quoted arguments.
(run-tests)
~~~~

To limit the depth of stack traces that are output when an exception is
thrown from a test, bind the special symbol `*stack-trace-depth*` to an
integer depth.

When AOT compiling Clojure code to bytecode for production use, bind the
`*load-tests*` symbol to `false` to avoid compiling test code.

While not on the same level as automated testing, Clojure provides an
`assert` macro. It takes an expression, evaluates it and throws an
exception if it evaluates to false. This is useful for catching
conditions that should never occur. For example:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(assert (>= dow 7000))
~~~~

Another important feature of the test library is fixtures. They are code
that wraps the execution of test methods. Fixtures come in two
varieties, those that wrap the execution of each test method and those
that wrap the execution of the entire run of test methods.

To create a fixture, write a function that follows this pattern:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(defn fixture-name [test-function]
  ; Perform setup here.
  (test-function)
  ; Perform teardown here.
)
~~~~

The fixture function will be called once for each test function. The
value of the `test-function` parameter will be the current function to
be executed.

To register fixtures to wrap each test method:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(use-fixtures :each fixture-1 fixture-2 ...)
~~~~

The order of execution will be:

1.  fixture-1 setup
2.  fixture-2 setup
3.  ONE test function
4.  fixture-2 teardown
5.  fixture-1 teardown

To register fixtures to wrap the entire run:

~~~~ {.clojure}
(use-fixtures :once fixture-1 fixture-2 ...)
~~~~

The order of execution will be:

1.  fixture-1 setup
2.  fixture-2 setup
3.  ALL test functions
4.  fixture-2 teardown
5.  fixture-1 teardown

Clojure ships with its own suite of tests in its `test` subdirectory. To
run them, cd to the directory containing the Clojure `src` and `test`
directories and enter "`ant test`".

Editors and IDEs
----------------

Clojure plugins for many editors and IDEs are available. For emacs there
is clojure-mode and swank-clojure, both at
[https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure](https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure).
swank-clojure uses the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs (Slime)
described at
[http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/).
For Vim there is VimClojure at
[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script\_id=2501](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501).
For NetBeans there is enclojure at
[http://enclojure.org/](http://enclojure.org/). For IDEA there a "La
Clojure" at
[http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=4050](http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=4050).
For Eclipse there is Counter Clockwise at
[http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Eclipse+and+Counterclockwise](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Eclipse+and+Counterclockwise).

Desktop Applications
--------------------

Clojure can be used to create Swing-based GUI applications. Here's a
simple example that allows the user to enter their name, press a "Greet"

macro to create a Java object that extends a given Java class (`JFrame`
in this case) and/or implements any number of Java interfaces (only
`ActionListener` in this case).

Web Applications
----------------

There are several Clojure libraries for creating web applications. A
popular choice these days is [Noir](http://webnoir.org/) by Chris
Granger. A simple, convention-based MVC framework, that uses Christophe
Grand's [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) for view templates,
is [Framework One](https://github.com/seancorfield/fw1-clj) by Sean
Corfield. Another popular choice is Compojure by James Reeves which can
be downloaded from
[http://github.com/weavejester/compojure/tree/master](http://github.com/weavejester/compojure/tree/master).
All of these web frameworks are based on
[Ring](https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring) by Mark McGranahan and
maintained by James Reeves. We're going to look at Compojure as an
example. The latest version can be retrieved from a
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository as follows (assuming Git is
already installed):

~~~~ {.clojure}
git clone git://github.com/weavejester/compojure.git
~~~~

This creates a directory named `compojure` in the current directory.
Additional JARs must be downloaded from
[http://cloud.github.com/downloads/weavejester/compojure/deps.zip](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/weavejester/compojure/deps.zip).
Place `deps.zip` in the `compojure` directory and unzip it to create a
`deps` subdirectory.

To build `compojure.jar`, run `ant` from the compojure directory.

To get updates to Compojure, cd to the `compojure` directory and run the
following commands:

~~~~ {.clojure}
git pull
ant clean deps jar
~~~~

All the JAR files in the `deps` subdirectory must be in the classpath.
One way to achieve this is to modify the `clj` script and use it to run
the web application. Add "`-cp $CP`" to the `java` command used to run
`clojure.main` and add the following lines (which are UNIX-specific)
before that to set `CP`.

~~~~ {.clojure}
# Set CP to a path list that contains clojure.jar
# and possibly some Clojure contrib JAR files.
COMPOJURE_DIR=path-to-compojure-dir
COMPOJURE_JAR=$COMPOJURE_DIR/compojure.jar
CP=$CP:$COMPOJURE_JAR
for file in $COMPOJURE_DIR/deps/*.jar
do
  CP=$CP:$file
done
~~~~

Here's an example of a simple Compojure web application.

![Compojure input page](images/Compojure1.png) ![Compojure output
page](images/Compojure2.png)

~~~~ {.clojure}
(ns com.ociweb.hello
  (:use compojure))

(def host "localhost")
(def port 8080)
(def in-path "/hello")
(def out-path "/hello-out")

(defn html-doc
  "generates well-formed HTML for a given title and body content"
  [title & body]
  (html
    (doctype :html4)
    [:html
      [:head [:title title]]
      [:body body]]))

; Creates HTML for input form.
(def hello-in
  (html-doc "Hello In"
    (form-to [:post out-path]
      "Name: "
      (text-field {:size 10} :name "World")
      [:br]
      (reset-button "Reset")
      (submit-button "Greet"))))

; Creates HTML for result message.
(defn hello-out [name]
  (html-doc "Hello Out"
    [:h1 "Hello, " name "!"]))

(defroutes hello-service
  ; The following three lines map HTTP methods
  ; and URL patterns to response HTML.
  (GET in-path hello-in)
  (POST out-path (hello-out (params :name)))
  (ANY "*" (page-not-found))) ; displays ./public/404.html by default

(println (str "browse http://" host ":" port in-path))
; -> browse http://localhost:8080/hello
(run-server {:port port} "/*" (servlet hello-service))
~~~~

Databases
---------

The jdbc library in [Clojure Contrib](#Libraries) simplifies accessing
relational databases. It supports transactions with commit and rollback,
prepared statements, creating/dropping tables,
inserting/updating/deleting rows, and running queries. The following
example connects to a Postgres database and runs a query. Values to use
for a MySQL database are provided in comments after the Postgres values.

~~~~ {.clojure}
(use 'clojure.java.jdbc)

(let [db-host "localhost"
      db-port 5432 ; 3306
      db-name "HR"]

  ; The classname below must be in the classpath.
  (def db {:classname "org.postgresql.Driver" ; com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
           :subprotocol "postgresql" ; "mysql"
           :subname (str "//" db-host ":" db-port "/" db-name)
           ; Any additional map entries are passed to the driver
           ; as driver-specific properties.
           :user "mvolkmann"
           :password "cljfan"})

  (with-connection db ; closes connection when finished
    (with-query-results rs ["select * from Employee"] ; closes result set when finished
      ; rs will be a non-lazy sequence of maps,
      ; one for each record in the result set.
      ; The keys in each map are the column names retrieved and
      ; their values are the column values for that result set row.
      (doseq [row rs] (println (row :lastname))))))
~~~~

The `clj-record` library provides a persistence API that is inspired by
the Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord library. For more information, browse
[http://github.com/duelinmarkers/clj-record/tree/master](http://github.com/duelinmarkers/clj-record/tree/master).

Libraries
---------

Many libraries of Clojure functions and macros that support capabilities
beyond what is in Clojure proper have been contributed and are part of
[Clojure Contrib](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Clojure+Contrib).
Some of these that were not discussed earlier are summarized below. In
addition, many of the known libraries are described at
[http://clojure.org/libraries](http://clojure.org/libraries).

-   clojure.tools.cli - processes command-line arguments and outputs
    help
-   clojure.data.xml - performs lazy parsing of XML
-   clojure.algo.monads - provides commonly used
    [monads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)),
    monad transformers, and macros for defining and using monads
-   clojure.java.shell - provides functions and macros for launching
    subprocesses and controlling their stdin/stdout
-   clojure.stacktrace - provides functions that simplify stack trace
    output by focusing on Clojure-specific content
-   clojure.string - provides functions for working with strings and
    regular expressions
-   clojure.tools.trace - provides tracing output for all calls to a
    given function and returns from it

Here's a brief example of using clojure.java.shell to obtain the "print
working directory".

~~~~ {.clojure}
(use 'clojure.java.shell)
(def directory (sh "pwd"))

Conclusion
----------

This article has covered a lot of ground. If you're hungry for more, a
great source is the book "[Programming
Clojure](http://pragprog.com/book/shcloj2/programming-clojure)" written
by [Stuart
Halloway](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=6).

This article focuses on the features of Clojure 1.0 and will be updated
by various community members over time. For a review of the changes in
Clojure 1.1 and beyond, see
[http://www.fogus.me/static/preso/clj1.1+/](http://www.fogus.me/static/preso/clj1.1+/).

Here are some key questions to ask yourself that will help in deciding
whether you should give Clojure a try.

-   Are you looking for a way to make concurrent programming easier?
-   Are you open to branching outside the world of object-oriented
    programming to try functional programming?
-   Is it important for the applications you write to run on the JVM in
    order to take advantage of existing Java libraries, portability and
    other benefits?
-   Do you prefer dynamically-typed languages over statically-typed
    ones?
-   Do you find the minimal, consistent syntax of Lisp dialects
    appealing?

If you answered "yes" to some of these questions then you should
consider using Clojure as your next programming language.
